68d8754f-53e3-5970-883f-1254423f6a09,proof,no,,no,yes,"1. **Assume the given conditions:**
   Let \( b, m, n \in \mathbb{N} \) with \( b > 1 \) and \( m \neq n \). Suppose that \( b^m - 1 \) and \( b^n - 1 \) have the same set of prime divisors.

2. **Without loss of generality (WLOG), assume \( m > n \):**
   This assumption does not lose generality because if \( m < n \), we can simply swap \( m \) and \( n \) in the argument.

3. **Apply Zsigmondy's theorem:**
   Zsigmondy's theorem states that for any integers \( a > 1 \) and \( k > 1 \), there exists a prime \( p \) that divides \( a^k - 1 \) but does not divide \( a^j - 1 \) for any \( j < k \), with the following exceptions:
   - \( (a, k) = (2, 6) \)
   - \( k = 2 \) and \( a + 1 \) is a power of 2

4. **Consider the exceptions to Zsigmondy's theorem:**
   - **Case 1:** \( (b, m) = (2, 6) \)
   - **Case 2:** \( m = 2 \) and \( b + 1 \) is a power of 2

5. **Analyze Case 1:**
   If \( (b, m) = (2, 6) \), then \( b = 2 \) and \( m = 6 \). We need to check the prime divisors of \( 2^6 - 1 = 63 \):
   \[
   63 = 3^2 \times 7
   \]
   The prime divisors of \( 63 \) are \( \{3, 7\} \).

   Now, check the prime divisors of \( 2^n - 1 \) for \( n < 6 \):
   - \( 2^5 - 1 = 31 \) (prime divisors: \( \{31\} \))
   - \( 2^4 - 1 = 15 \) (prime divisors: \( \{3, 5\} \))
   - \( 2^3 - 1 = 7 \) (prime divisors: \( \{7\} \))
   - \( 2^2 - 1 = 3 \) (prime divisors: \( \{3\} \))
   - \( 2^1 - 1 = 1 \) (no prime divisors)

   Since the set of prime divisors of \( 2^6 - 1 \) is \( \{3, 7\} \) and none of the other \( 2^n - 1 \) for \( n < 6 \) have the same set of prime divisors, this case leads to a contradiction.

6. **Analyze Case 2:**
   If \( m = 2 \) and \( b + 1 \) is a power of 2, then \( b + 1 = 2^k \) for some integer \( k \). This implies:
   \[
   b = 2^k - 1
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   Since Case 1 leads to a contradiction, Case 2 must hold. Therefore, \( b + 1 \) must be a power of 2.

The final answer is \( \boxed{ b + 1 } \) must be a power of 2.","Let $b,m,n\in\mathbb{N}$ with $b>1$ and $m\not=n$. Suppose that $b^{m}-1$ and $b^{n}-1$ have the same set of prime divisors. Show that $b+1$ must be a power of $2$.",,"import Mathlib

2. **Proof using Bézout's Lemma**:
   - Bézout's Lemma states that for any integers \( a \) and \( b \), there exist integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( ax - by = \gcd(a, b) \).
   - We can find non-negative integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( ax - by = \gcd(a, b) \).
   - Rearranging, we get \( b(y + 1) - a(x - 1) = a + b - \gcd(a, b) \).
   - This shows that it is possible to perform a sequence of moves that cover \( a + b - \gcd(a, b) \) rungs.

3. **Verification**:
   - Suppose \( n < a + b - 1 \).
   - Considering all the moves in total, we have \( ax = by \) for some \( x, y \in \mathbb{Z} \), implying that we move down at least \( a \) times and similarly move up at least \( b \) times.
   - Since \( \gcd(a, b) = 1 \), \( b \cdot k \) (for \( k \in \{0, 1, \dots, a-1\} \)) forms a complete residue system modulo \( a \), so we would necessarily have the height be \( b - 1 \pmod{a} \) at some point.
   - But since \( n < a + b - 1 \), we have no legal move at this point, which is a contradiction.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, the minimum value of \( n \) is \( a + b - \gcd(a, b) \).

\[
(c - b)\int_a^b f(x)\, \text{d}x \le (b - a) \int_b^c f(x) \, \text{d}x,
\]

for any real numbers \( a < b < c \), we will prove both directions of the equivalence.

### Only If Direction:
Assume \( f \) is increasing. We need to show that 

\[
(c - b)\int_a^b f(x)\, \text{d}x \le (b - a) \int_b^c f(x) \, \text{d}x.
\]

1. Since \( f \) is increasing, for \( x \in [a, b] \) and \( y \in [b, c] \), we have \( f(x) \le f(b) \le f(y) \).
2. Therefore, 

\[
\int_a^b f(x) \, \text{d}x \le (b - a) f(b) \quad \text{and} \quad \int_b^c f(y) \, \text{d}x \ge (c - b) f(b).
\]

3. Multiplying these inequalities by \( c - b \) and \( b - a \) respectively, we get:

\[
(c - b) \int_a^b f(x) \, \text{d}x \le (c - b)(b - a) f(b) \quad \text{and} \quad (b - a) \int_b^c f(y) \, \text{d}x \ge (b - a)(c - b) f(b).
\]

4. Since both sides of the inequalities are equal to \((b - a)(c - b) f(b)\), we have:

\[
(c - b) \int_a^b f(x) \, \text{d}x \le (b - a) \int_b^c f(x) \, \text{d}x.
\]

### If Direction:
Assume 

\[
(c - b)\int_a^b f(x)\, \text{d}x \le (b - a) \int_b^c f(x) \, \text{d}x,
\]

for any \( a < b < c \). We need to show that \( f \) is increasing.

1. Divide the inequality by \((c - b)(b - a)\):

\[
\frac{\int_a^b f(x) \, \text{d}x}{b - a} \le \frac{\int_b^c f(x) \, \text{d}x}{c - b}.
\]

2. As \( a \to b \), the left-hand side approaches \( f(a) \) by the continuity of \( f \):

\[
f(a) \le \frac{\int_b^c f(x) \, \text{d}x}{c - b}.
\]

   \[
   \sin^2{x} + \cos^2{y} = y^4
   \]
   \[
   \sin^2{y} + \cos^2{x} = x^2
   \]

2. We claim that \((x, y) = (\pm 1, \pm 1)\) is the only solution. Note that if \((x, y)\) is a solution, then \((\pm x, \pm y)\) are also solutions due to the symmetry of the trigonometric functions and the even powers.

3. Assume \(x, y \geq 0\). Summing the two equations, we get:
   \[
   \sin^2{x} + \cos^2{y} + \sin^2{y} + \cos^2{x} = y^4 + x^2
   \]
   Using the Pythagorean identities \(\sin^2{x} + \cos^2{x} = 1\) and \(\sin^2{y} + \cos^2{y} = 1\), we have:
   \[
   1 + 1 = y^4 + x^2
   \]
   \[
   2 = y^4 + x^2
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   x^2 + y^4 = 2
   \]

4. Since \(x^2 + y^4 = 2\), we have \(y^4 \leq 2\). This implies \(0 \leq y < \sqrt[4]{2}\). Given that \(y\) is in the range \([0, \pi/2)\), we can use the fact that \(\sin(\cdot)\) and \(\cos(\cdot)\) are increasing and decreasing functions respectively in this interval.

5. Express \(x\) in terms of \(y\):
   \[
   x = \sqrt{2 - y^4}
   \]

6. Substitute \(x = \sqrt{2 - y^4}\) into the second equation:
   \[
   \sin^2{y} + \cos^2{\sqrt{2 - y^4}} = 2 - y^4
   \]

7. Consider the function \(f(y) = \sin^2{y} + \cos^2{\sqrt{2 - y^4}}\). We need to check if this function equals \(2 - y^4\) for \(0 \leq y < \sqrt[4]{2}\).

8. Notice that if \(y^4 > 1\), then \(y > 1\). This would imply \(\sqrt{2 - y^4} < y\), which is a contradiction since \(y^4 + y^2 - 2 < 0\) would not hold. Hence, \(y < 1\).

9. If \(y^4 < 1\), then \(y < 1\). This implies \(y = 1\) is the only possible solution for \(y > 0\).

10. Substituting \(y = 1\) into the equation \(x^2 + y^4 = 2\), we get:
    \[
    x^2 + 1 = 2
    \]
    \[
    x^2 = 1
    \]
    \[
    x = 1
    \]

11. Therefore, the only solution in the positive quadrant is \((x, y) = (1, 1)\). By symmetry, the solutions are \((\pm 1, \pm 1)\).

2. According to the problem, any two sides of the triangle must differ in length by at least 10 matches. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   A \geq B + 10 \quad \text{and} \quad B \geq C + 10
   \]
3. Since these numbers represent the sides of a triangle, they must also satisfy the triangle inequality:
   \[
   B + C > A
   \]
4. Combining these inequalities, we get:
   \[
   B + C > A \geq B + 10 \geq C + 20
   \]
5. From \( B + C > A \) and \( A \geq B + 10 \), we can deduce:
   \[
   B + C > B + 10 \implies C > 10
   \]
6. From \( B \geq C + 10 \), we can deduce:
   \[
   B \geq 20
   \]
7. The minimum value for \( B \) is 20, which corresponds to the minimum value for \( A \), which is 30 (since \( A \geq B + 10 \)).
8. Now, it must be \( C \leq 10 \). If \( C = 10 \), it would lead to \( B + C = A \), which contradicts the requirement for a triangle (\( B + C \) must be greater than \( A \)).
9. Therefore, the solution with the minimum number of matches is when \( A = 31 \), \( B = 21 \), and \( C = 11 \). In this case, the total number of matches is:
   \[
   A + B + C = 31 + 21 + 11 = 63

Therefore, the divisors $\mathrm{a}$ and $\frac{n}{a}$ can be paired. Only when $\mathrm{n}=\mathrm{a}^{2}$, $\mathrm{a}$ and $\frac{n}{\mathrm{a}}$ are equal. So, when $\mathrm{n}$ is not a perfect square, its divisors can be paired, making the number of divisors even; when $\mathrm{n}$ is a perfect square $\mathrm{a}^{2}$, its divisor $\mathrm{a}$ can only pair with itself, making the number of divisors odd.

2bae547e-c72c-5d4f-800e-fed9f64dc572,math-word-problem,no,,no,yes,"To determine all possible values of \( a_{2013} \), we start by analyzing the given condition for the sequence \( a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots \):

\[ a_{pk+1} = pa_k - 3a_p + 13 \]

We will use specific values of \( p \) and \( k \) to find the values of \( a_n \).

1. **Using \( p = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \):**
   \[
   a_{2 \cdot 2 + 1} = a_5 = 2a_2 - 3a_2 + 13 = 13 - a_2
   \]

2. **Using \( p = 2 \) and \( k = 5 \):**
   \[
   a_{2 \cdot 5 + 1} = a_{11} = 2a_5 - 3a_2 + 13
   \]

3. **Using \( p = 5 \) and \( k = 2 \):**
   \[
   a_{5 \cdot 2 + 1} = a_{11} = 5a_2 - 3a_5 + 13
   \]

Equating the two expressions for \( a_{11} \):
\[
2a_5 - 3a_2 + 13 = 5a_2 - 3a_5 + 13
\]

Simplifying:
\[
2a_5 + 3a_5 = 5a_2 + 3a_2
\]
\[
5a_5 = 8a_2
\]
\[
a_5 = \frac{8}{5}a_2
\]

From step 1, we have:
\[
a_5 = 13 - a_2
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( a_5 \):
\[
13 - a_2 = \frac{8}{5}a_2
\]
\[
13 = \frac{13}{5}a_2
\]
\[
a_2 = 5
\]

4. **Using \( p = 3 \) and \( k = 2 \):**
   \[
   a_{3 \cdot 2 + 1} = a_7 = 3a_2 - 3a_3 + 13 = 15 - 3a_3 + 13 = 28 - 3a_3
   \]

5. **Using \( p = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \):**
   \[
   a_{2 \cdot 3 + 1} = a_7 = 2a_3 - 3a_2 + 13 = 2a_3 - 15 + 13 = 2a_3 - 2
   \]

Equating the two expressions for \( a_7 \):
\[
28 - 3a_3 = 2a_3 - 2
\]
\[
30 = 5a_3
\]
\[
a_3 = 6
\]

6. **Using \( p = 2 \) and \( k = 1 \):**
   \[
   a_{2 \cdot 1 + 1} = a_3 = 2a_1 - 3a_2 + 13
   \]
   \[
   6 = 2a_1 - 15 + 13
   \]
   \[
   6 = 2a_1 - 2
   \]
   \[
   8 = 2a_1
   \]
   \[
   a_1 = 4
   \]

Now, we will prove by induction that \( a_n = n + 3 \) for every \( n \).

**Base Case:**
For \( n = 1 \):
\[
a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3
\]

**Inductive Step:**
Assume \( a_k = k + 3 \) for some \( k \). We need to show \( a_{pk+1} = pk + 4 \).

Using the given condition:
\[
a_{pk+1} = pa_k - 3a_p + 13
\]
By the inductive hypothesis:
\[
a_k = k + 3 \quad \text{and} \quad a_p = p + 3
\]
\[
a_{pk+1} = p(k + 3) - 3(p + 3) + 13
\]
\[
a_{pk+1} = pk + 3p - 3p - 9 + 13
\]
\[
a_{pk+1} = pk + 4
\]

Thus, by induction, \( a_n = n + 3 \) for all \( n \).

The final answer is \( a_{2013} = 2013 + 3 = \boxed{2016} \).","Fix a sequence $ a_1,a_2,a_3,... $ of integers satisfying the following condition:for all prime numbers $ p $ and all positive integers $ k $, we have $ a_{pk+1}=pa_k-3a_p+13 $.Determine all possible values of $ a_{2013} $.",,"import Mathlib

   \[
   3x^2 + x = 4y^2 + y
   \]

2. Assume \( \gcd(x, y) = d \) and let \( x = da \) and \( y = db \) where \( \gcd(a, b) = 1 \). Substitute these into the equation:
   \[
   3(da)^2 + da = 4(db)^2 + db
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   3d^2a^2 + da = 4d^2b^2 + db
   \]

3. Rearrange the equation:
   \[
   3d^2a^2 - 4d^2b^2 + da - db = 0
   \]
   Factor out \( d \):
   \[
   d(3da^2 - 4db^2 + a - b) = 0
   \]
   Since \( d \neq 0 \), we have:
   \[
   3da^2 - 4db^2 + a - b = 0
   \]

4. Rearrange to isolate terms involving \( d \):
   \[
   3d(a^2 - b^2) + (a - b) = 0
   \]
   Factor \( a^2 - b^2 \):
   \[
   3d(a - b)(a + b) + (a - b) = 0
   \]
   Factor out \( a - b \):
   \[
   (a - b)(3d(a + b) + 1) = 0
   \]

5. Since \( a \) and \( b \) are integers, \( a \neq b \), so:
   \[
   3d(a + b) + 1 = 0
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   3d(a + b) = -1
   \]
   Since \( d \), \( a \), and \( b \) are positive integers, this equation has no solution. Therefore, we must reconsider our approach.

6. Instead, consider the equation modulo \( d \):
   \[
   3d^2(a^2 - b^2) + d(a - b) = 0
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   d(3d(a^2 - b^2) + (a - b)) = 0
   \]
   Since \( d \neq 0 \):
   \[
   3d(a^2 - b^2) + (a - b) = 0
   \]

7. Let \( k = a - b \). Then:
   \[
   3d(a^2 - b^2) = -k
   \]
   Since \( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \):
   \[
   3d(a - b)(a + b) = -k
   \]
   Substitute \( k \):
   \[
   3d(a - b)(a + b) = -(a - b)
   \]
   Divide both sides by \( a - b \):
   \[
   3d(a + b) = -1
   \]
   This again implies no solution since \( d \), \( a \), and \( b \) are positive integers.

8. Reconsider the original equation:
   \[
   3x^2 + x = 4y^2 + y
   \]
   Rearrange:
   \[
   3x^2 - 4y^2 = y - x
   \]
   Factor the left-hand side:
   \[
   (3x - 4y)(x + y) = y - x
   \]

9. Let \( k = x - y \). Then:
   \[
   (3x - 4y)(x + y) = -k
   \]
   Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers, \( k \) must be a perfect square.

10. Therefore, \( x - y \) is a perfect square.

If $2^n$ is a divisor of two of these numbers, then these numbers are of the form $2^n p$ and $2^n q$ for $p$ and $q$ being odd numbers. Since there is an even number between any two odd natural numbers, it follows that there is a natural number of the form $2^n r$ for $r$ being an even number, between $2^n p$ and $2^n q$, and thus also between $2,3,4, \ldots, k$. Therefore, $2^{n+1}$ is a divisor of one of the numbers $2,3,4, \ldots, k$. This means there is only one number among $2,3,4, \ldots, k$ that is divisible by $2^n$. Let $m$ be that number. The least common multiple of the numbers $2,3,4, \ldots, k$ is of the form $2^n s$, where $s$ is an odd number. Let $x_i = \frac{2^n s}{i}$, for $i=2,3,4, \ldots, k$. Then $x_i$ is an even number for every $i \neq m$ and $x_m$ is odd. The given sum is

$$

849abfc0-9374-5f15-b15a-a010e2bc1eb9,proof,no,,no,yes,"1. **Define the problem and given conditions:**
   - We are given a triangle \(ABC\) where the medians from \(B\) and \(C\) are perpendicular.
   - We need to prove that \(\frac{\sin(B+C)}{\sin B \cdot \sin C} \geq \frac{2}{3}\).

2. **Introduce the centroid and medians:**
   - Let \(G\) be the centroid of the triangle.
   - The median from \(B\) intersects \(AC\) at \(B'\) and the median from \(C\) intersects \(AB\) at \(C'\).
   - Since \(G\) is the centroid, \(BG = \frac{2}{3}BB'\) and \(CG = \frac{2}{3}CC'\).

3. **Use the properties of medians and centroids:**
   - Since \(G\) is the centroid, \(GB' = \frac{1}{3}BB'\) and \(GC' = \frac{1}{3}CC'\).
   - Given that the medians are perpendicular, triangles \(BC'G\) and \(B'CG\) are right triangles.

4. **Express \(\sin B\) and \(\sin C\) using the given conditions:**
   - Using the right triangle properties and the sine angle formulas, we have:
     \[
     \sin B = \frac{3bc}{\sqrt{(4b^2+c^2)(b^2+c^2)}}
     \]
     \[
     \sin C = \frac{3bc}{\sqrt{(4c^2+b^2)(b^2+c^2)}}
     \]

5. **Express \(\sin (B+C)\) in terms of \(\sin A\):**
   - Since \(\sin (B+C) = \sin A\), we need to find \(\sin A\).
   - Using the area properties of the triangle, we have:
     \[
     [GBC] = 2bc
     \]
     \[
     [GBC'] = [GB'C] = bc
     \]
     \[
     [AB'GC'] = 2bc
     \]
     \[
     [C'GB'] = \frac{bc}{2}
     \]
     \[
     [AB'C'] = \frac{3bc}{2}
     \]
   - Therefore, using the area formula:
     \[
     [AB'C'] = \frac{|AB'| \cdot |AC'|}{2} \sin A \Rightarrow \sin A = \frac{3bc}{\sqrt{(4b^2+c^2)(b^2+4c^2)}}
     \]

6. **Combine the expressions to find the desired ratio:**
   - We have:
     \[
     \frac{\sin A}{\sin B \cdot \sin C} = \frac{\frac{3bc}{\sqrt{(4b^2+c^2)(b^2+4c^2)}}}{\left(\frac{3bc}{\sqrt{(4b^2+c^2)(b^2+c^2)}}\right) \left(\frac{3bc}{\sqrt{(4c^2+b^2)(b^2+c^2)}}\right)}
     \]
   - Simplifying the expression:
     \[
     \frac{\sin A}{\sin B \cdot \sin C} = \frac{3bc}{\sqrt{(4b^2+c^2)(b^2+4c^2)}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{(4b^2+c^2)(b^2+c^2)} \cdot \sqrt{(4c^2+b^2)(b^2+c^2)}}{(3bc)^2}
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{3bc \cdot \sqrt{(4b^2+c^2)(b^2+c^2)} \cdot \sqrt{(4c^2+b^2)(b^2+c^2)}}{(3bc)^2 \cdot \sqrt{(4b^2+c^2)(b^2+4c^2)}}
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{\sqrt{(4b^2+c^2)(4c^2+b^2)}}{3bc}
     \]

7. **Use the inequality \(b^2 + c^2 \geq 2bc\):**
   - We know that \(b^2 + c^2 \geq 2bc\), so:
     \[
     \frac{\sqrt{(4b^2+c^2)(4c^2+b^2)}}{3bc} \geq \frac{2}{3}
     \]

8. **Conclude the proof:**
   - Therefore, we have shown that:
     \[
     \frac{\sin(B+C)}{\sin B \cdot \sin C} \geq \frac{2}{3}
     \]
   - This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)",In triangle $ABC$ medians from $B$ and $C$ are perpendicular. Prove that $\frac{\sin(B+C)}{\sin B \cdot \sin C} \geq \frac{2}{3}.$,,"import Mathlib

Let $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{OA}}=\overrightarrow{\mathrm{a}}, \overrightarrow{\mathrm{OB}}=\overrightarrow{\mathrm{b}}, \overrightarrow{\mathrm{OC}}=\overrightarrow{\mathrm{C}}$. According to the conditions, $A$ and $C$ are both on the unit circle centered at 0, $|O B|=2$, and $\angle B O A=60^{\circ}$.
Extend $A O$ to intersect $\odot 0$ at $D$, and take the midpoint of $O D$ as $E$, then $\left|c+\frac{\vec{a}}{2}\right|=|E C|$.
On $O B$, take point $F$ such that $|O F|=\frac{1}{2}$, then $\frac{O F \mid}{|O C|}=\frac{|O C|}{|O B|}=\frac{1}{2}$, hence $\triangle O C F \sim \triangle O B C$, so $\frac{1}{2}|\vec{c}-\vec{b}|=\frac{|B C|}{2}=$ $|\mathrm{FC}|$. Therefore, we know:
$$
\left|\vec{c}+\frac{\vec{a}}{2}\right|+\frac{1}{2}|\vec{c}-\vec{b}|=|\mathrm{EC}|+|\mathrm{FC}|
$$
(1) First, find the minimum value. In fact, according to Ptolemy's theorem:
$$
|\mathrm{EC}| \cdot|\mathrm{OF}|+|\mathrm{FC}| \cdot|\mathrm{OE}| \geq|\mathrm{EF}| \cdot|\mathrm{OC}| \Rightarrow|\mathrm{EC}|+|\mathrm{FC}| \geq \sqrt{3}
$$

Equality holds if and only if $\angle C O D=60^{\circ}$.
(2) Next, find the maximum value. In fact,
$$
\begin{array}{l}

\leq 2\left(2+\frac{1}{2}+2 \cos \frac{\angle \mathrm{BOD}}{2}\right)=7

$y=0 \Longrightarrow z^{2}=0 \Longrightarrow z=0 \Longrightarrow \frac{1}{4} x^{4}=0 \Longrightarrow x=0 . x=y=z=0$ is a solution, so assume that $y \neq 0$. Then $z=0 \Longrightarrow x^{2} y=0 \Longrightarrow x=0 \Longrightarrow \frac{1}{4} y^{4}=0$, which is a contradiction. Hence $z \neq 0$. Now we solve the quadratic (first) equation w.r.t. $x, y$, and $z$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& x= \pm \frac{\sqrt{-4 y^{3} z-4 y z^{2}}}{2 y} \\
& y=\frac{-x^{2} \pm \sqrt{x^{4}-4 z^{3}}}{2 z} \\
& z=\frac{-y^{2} \pm \sqrt{y^{4}-4 x^{2} y}}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

The discriminants must be non-negative.

$$
\begin{gathered}
-4 y^{3} z-4 y z^{2} \geqslant 0 \\
x^{4}-4 z^{3} \geqslant 0 \\
y^{4}-4 x^{2} y \geqslant 0

Adding the inequalities we get

$$
\begin{gathered}
y^{4}-4 x^{2} y+x^{4}-4 z^{3}-4 y^{3} z-4 y z^{2} \geqslant 0 \\
\frac{1}{4}\left(x^{4}+y^{4}\right) \geqslant z^{3}+z^{2} y+z y^{3}+x^{2} y
\end{gathered}
$$

But equation 2 says that $\frac{1}{4}\left(x^{4}+y^{4}\right)=z^{3}+z^{2} y+z y^{3}+x^{2} y$. This is only possible if all of the inequalities are in fact equalities, so we have

$$
\begin{gathered}
-4 y^{3} z-4 y z^{2}=0 \\
x^{4}-4 z^{3}=0 \\
y^{4}-4 x^{2} y=0
\end{gathered}
$$

This means that $x= \pm \frac{\sqrt{0}}{2 y}=0 \Longrightarrow y=\frac{-0^{2} \pm \sqrt{0}}{2 z}=0$, which is a contradiction. Hence the only solution is $x=y=z=0$.",". Find all real numbers $x, y, z$ so that

To derive a contradiction, we first prove some properties of the function $f$.
We can assume $f(0)=1$.
Indeed, let $a \in \mathbf{R}$ such that $f(a)=1$.
Consider the function $g(x)=f(x+a)$.
Substitute $x+a$ and $y+a$ for $x$ and $y$ in equation (1) to get
$$
\begin{array}{l}
g\left(x+\frac{1}{g(y)}\right)=f\left(x+a+\frac{1}{f(y+a)}\right) \\
=f\left(y+a+\frac{1}{f(x+a)}\right)=g\left(y+\frac{1}{g(x)}\right) .
\end{array}
$$

Therefore, $g$ also satisfies the functional equation (1), and $g(0)=1$.
Combining $g$ and $f$ have the same range, i.e., $g(\mathbf{R})=f(\mathbf{R})=\mathbf{N}_{+}$, we can assume $f(0)=1$.
Proposition 1 For any fixed $c \in \mathbf{R}$, we have $\left\{\left.f\left(c+\frac{1}{n}\right) \right\rvert\, n \in \mathbf{N}_{+}\right\}=\mathbf{N}_{+}$.
Proof of Proposition 1: From equation (1) and $f(\mathbf{R})=\mathbf{N}$, we get
$$
\begin{array}{l}
f(\mathbf{R})=\left\{\left.f\left(x+\frac{1}{f(c)}\right) \right\rvert\, x \in \mathbf{R}\right\} \\
=\left\{\left.f\left(c+\frac{1}{f(x)}\right) \right\rvert\, x \in \mathbf{R}\right\} \\
\subset\left\{\left.f\left(c+\frac{1}{n}\right) \right\rvert\, n \in \mathbf{N}_{+}\right\} \subset f(\mathbf{R}) .
\end{array}
$$

Proposition 1 is proved.
In particular, setting $c=0$ and $c=\frac{1}{3}$ in Proposition 1, we get
$$
\left\{\left.f\left(\frac{1}{n}\right) \right\rvert\, n \in \mathbf{N}_{+}\right\}=\left\{\left.f\left(\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{n}\right) \right\rvert\, n \in \mathbf{N}_{+}\right\}=\mathbf{N}_{+} .
$$

Proposition 2 If for some two real numbers $u, v$, we have $f(u)=f(v)$, then for all non-negative rational numbers $q$, we have
$$
f(u+q)=f(v+q) .
$$

Proof of Proposition 2: For any real number $x$, from equation (1) we get
$$
\begin{array}{l}
f\left(u+\frac{1}{f(x)}\right)=f\left(x+\frac{1}{f(u)}\right) \\
=f\left(x+\frac{1}{f(v)}\right)=f\left(v+\frac{1}{f(x)}\right) .
\end{array}
$$

Since $f(x)$ can take all positive integers, for any $n \in \mathbf{N}_{+}$, we have
$$
f\left(u+\frac{1}{n}\right)=f\left(v+\frac{1}{n}\right) .
$$

Let the positive rational number $q=\frac{k}{n}\left(k, n \in \mathbf{N}_{+}\right)$.
Using the above equality $k$ times, we get
$f(u+q)=f\left(u+\frac{k}{n}\right)$
$$
=f\left(v+\frac{k}{n}\right)=f(v+q) \text {. }
$$

Proposition 2 is proved.
Suppose there exists some non-negative rational number $q$ such that $f(q)=1$. For any positive integer $k$, since $f(0)=1$, then $f(0)=f(q)$. Thus,
$$

In the given time, Marko, cycling at a constant speed, covered a distance of $9 \mathrm{~km}=9000 \mathrm{~m}$, which means he covered 9000 : $1800=5$ lengths of the track.

Luka, in the given time, running at a constant speed, covered a distance of $4.5 \mathrm{~km}=4500 \mathrm{~m}$, which means he covered $4500: 1800=2.5$ lengths of the track.

1 POINT

After 30 minutes from the start of the training, Marko was at the end of the track, and Luka was at the halfway point, which means they were $900 \mathrm{~m}$ apart.

Marko covered the distance from $A$ to $B$ and then from $B$ to $S$, which can also be represented as follows:

However, the distance Marko covered is twice as much, so the distance from $S$ to $B$ and back from $B$ to $S$ is equal to the distance from $A$ to $S$.

   \[
   S(m,n) = \left\{(a,b) \in \mathbb{N}_+^2 \mid 1 \leq a \leq m, 1 \leq b \leq n, \gcd(a,b) = 1 \right\}
   \]
   We need to prove that for any \( d, r \in \mathbb{N}_+ \), there exist \( m, n \in \mathbb{N}_+ \) with \( m, n \geq d \) such that \( |S(m,n)| \equiv r \pmod{d} \).

2. **Choose specific values for \( m \) and \( n \):**
   Let \( m = r + d \) and \( n = 1 + d \prod_{p < m} p^2 \), where the product is taken over all primes \( p \) less than \( m \).

3. **Calculate \( |S(m,1)| \):**
   Since \( n = 1 \), the set \( S(m,1) \) consists of pairs \( (a,1) \) where \( 1 \leq a \leq m \) and \( \gcd(a,1) = 1 \). Clearly, \( \gcd(a,1) = 1 \) for all \( a \), so:
   \[
   |S(m,1)| = m = r + d
   \]

4. **Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion (PIE) to calculate \( |S(m,n)| \):**
   The number of pairs \( (a,b) \) such that \( \gcd(a,b) = 1 \) can be calculated using the Möbius function \( \mu \) and the principle of inclusion-exclusion:
   \[
   |S(m,n)| = \sum_{k \text{ squarefree}, k \leq m} (-1)^{\omega(k)} \left\lfloor \frac{m}{k} \right\rfloor \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor
   \]
   where \( \omega(k) \) is the number of distinct prime factors of \( k \).

5. **Calculate the difference \( |S(m,n)| - |S(m,1)| \):**
   \[
   |S(m,n)| - |S(m,1)| = \sum_{k \text{ squarefree}, k \leq m} (-1)^{\omega(k)} \left\lfloor \frac{m}{k} \right\rfloor \left( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor - 1 \right)
   \]
   Since \( n = 1 + d \prod_{p < m} p^2 \), for \( k \leq m \), \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor \) is a multiple of \( d \):
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{1 + d \prod_{p < m} p^2}{k} \right\rfloor = d \left\lfloor \frac{\prod_{p < m} p^2}{k} \right\rfloor
   \]
   Therefore, \( \left( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor - 1 \right) \) is also a multiple of \( d \):
   \[
   \left( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor - 1 \right) = d \left\lfloor \frac{\prod_{p < m} p^2}{k} \right\rfloor - 1
   \]

6. **Conclude that the difference is divisible by \( d \):**
   \[
   |S(m,n)| - |S(m,1)| = \sum_{k \text{ squarefree}, k \leq m} (-1)^{\omega(k)} \left\lfloor \frac{m}{k} \right\rfloor d \left\lfloor \frac{\prod_{p < m} p^2}{k} \right\rfloor
   \]
   Since each term in the sum is divisible by \( d \), the entire sum is divisible by \( d \):
   \[
   |S(m,n)| - |S(m,1)| \equiv 0 \pmod{d}
   \]

7. **Final conclusion:**
   \[
   |S(m,n)| \equiv |S(m,1)| \pmod{d}
   \]
   Since \( |S(m,1)| = r + d \), we have:
   \[
   |S(m,n)| \equiv r + d \equiv r \pmod{d}
   \]

The final answer is \( \boxed{ |S(m,n)| \equiv r \pmod{d} } \)","Given $m,n\in\mathbb N_+,$ define

   - We start with \( a_1 = 1 \).
   - For \( n \geq 2 \), \( a_n \) is the \( n \)-th positive integer greater than \( a_{n-1} \) which is congruent to \( n \mod K \).

2. **Finding the explicit formula for \( a_n \):**
   - We need to find \( a_n \) such that \( a_n \equiv n \pmod{K} \) and \( a_n \) is the \( n \)-th such integer greater than \( a_{n-1} \).
   - Let's denote the \( n \)-th positive integer greater than \( a_{n-1} \) which is congruent to \( n \mod K \) as \( a_{n-1} + mK + n \), where \( m \) is an integer.

3. **Deriving the formula:**
   - Since \( a_n \) is the \( n \)-th such integer, we need to find \( m \) such that there are \( n \) integers of the form \( a_{n-1} + mK + n \) greater than \( a_{n-1} \).
   - The first such integer greater than \( a_{n-1} \) is \( a_{n-1} + K + n \).
   - The second such integer is \( a_{n-1} + 2K + n \).
   - Continuing this pattern, the \( n \)-th such integer is \( a_{n-1} + nK + n \).

4. **Simplifying the formula:**
   - Therefore, \( a_n = a_{n-1} + nK + n \).
   - We can rewrite this as \( a_n = a_{n-1} + n(K + 1) \).

5. **Finding the general term:**
   - We start with \( a_1 = 1 \).
   - For \( n = 2 \), \( a_2 = a_1 + 2(K + 1) = 1 + 2(K + 1) = 1 + 2K + 2 \).
   - For \( n = 3 \), \( a_3 = a_2 + 3(K + 1) = (1 + 2K + 2) + 3(K + 1) = 1 + 2K + 2 + 3K + 3 = 1 + 5K + 5 \).
   - Continuing this pattern, we get \( a_n = 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i(K + 1) \).

6. **Summing the series:**
   - The sum of the first \( n-1 \) positive integers is \( \frac{(n-1)n}{2} \).
   - Therefore, \( a_n = 1 + (K + 1) \cdot \frac{(n-1)n}{2} \).

7. **Final formula:**
   - Simplifying, we get \( a_n = 1 + \frac{(K + 1)(n-1)n}{2} \).

8. **Special case when \( K = 2 \):**
   - Substituting \( K = 2 \) into the formula, we get \( a_n = 1 + \frac{(2 + 1)(n-1)n}{2} = 1 + \frac{3(n-1)n}{2} \).
   - Simplifying further, \( a_n = 1 + \frac{3n^2 - 3n}{2} = 1 + \frac{3n^2}{2} - \frac{3n}{2} \).
   - This simplifies to \( a_n = \frac{3n^2 - 3n + 2}{2} \).

The final answer is \( \boxed{ a_n = \frac{3n^2 - 3n + 2}{2} } \).","A positive integer $K$ is given. Define the sequence $(a_n)$ by $a_1 = 1$ and $a_n$ is the $n$-th positive integer greater than $a_{n-1}$ which is congruent to $n$ modulo $K$.

From the obtained pairs, we will choose the one that satisfies the first condition - the sum of the digits should equal a certain two-digit number:
$1+4=5$ - does not satisfy;

$2+8=10-$ satisfies.

Second method of solving. Let's represent the problem condition in the form of a diagram.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_e53d4ff4f2278a1c0d12g-026.jpg?height=166&width=366&top_left_y=545&top_left_x=822)

Let $x$ be the number of tens. Then $4x$ is the number of units. The smallest two-digit number is 10. We will form an equation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& x+4x=10 \\
& 5x=10 \\
& x=2
\end{aligned}
$$

Then $2 \times 4=8$.

Therefore, the number 28 satisfies the condition. Similarly, we can form equations for other numbers from 11 to 18 and draw a conclusion.

Third method of solving. Based on the problem condition, the sum of the digits must be divisible by 5. There are two such numbers:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 10: 5=2 \\
& 2 \times 4=8
\end{aligned}
$$

We get the number 28.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 15: 5=3 \\
& 3 \times 4=12
\end{aligned}
$$

In this case, we do not get a two-digit number.

Thus $a(x-a)^{2}+b(x-b)^{2}=0$ only when $\mathrm{x}=\mathrm{a}=\mathrm{b}$.
If $a$ and $b$ are both negative, then the reasoning is similar.
If $\mathrm{a}$ and $\mathrm{b}$ have opposite signs, we rewrite the equation as follows:

e561da7f-3562-5608-a842-306627b97660,proof,no,,no,yes,"To prove the given statement by induction, we will follow these steps:

1. **Base Case:**
   Verify the statement for \( n = 1 \).

2. **Inductive Step:**
   Assume the statement holds for some \( n = k \), and then prove it for \( n = k+1 \).

### Base Case:
For \( n = 1 \):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{1 + 2^0}{2^1} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{1 + 1}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1 \right\rfloor = 1
\]
Thus, the base case holds.

### Inductive Step:
Assume the statement holds for \( n = k \), i.e.,
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{k + 2^0}{2^1} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{k + 2^1}{2^2} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{k + 2^{k-1}}{2^k} \right\rfloor = k
\]

We need to show that:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{(k+1) + 2^0}{2^1} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{(k+1) + 2^1}{2^2} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{(k+1) + 2^k}{2^{k+1}} \right\rfloor = k+1
\]

### Case 1: \( k \) is even
Let \( k = 2m \). Then:
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left\lfloor \frac{2m + 2^i}{2^{i+1}} \right\rfloor = 2m
\]
We need to show:
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{k} \left\lfloor \frac{2m + 1 + 2^i}{2^{i+1}} \right\rfloor = 2m + 1
\]

For \( i = 0 \):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{2m + 1 + 2^0}{2^1} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{2m + 1 + 1}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{2m + 2}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor m + 1 \right\rfloor = m + 1
\]

For \( i \geq 1 \):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{2m + 1 + 2^i}{2^{i+1}} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{2m + 2^i + 1}{2^{i+1}} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{2m + 2^i}{2^{i+1}} + \frac{1}{2^{i+1}} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{2m + 2^i}{2^{i+1}} \right\rfloor
\]

Thus:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{k} \left\lfloor \frac{2m + 1 + 2^i}{2^{i+1}} \right\rfloor = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \left\lfloor \frac{2m + 2^i}{2^{i+1}} \right\rfloor = 2m - m = m
\]

Adding the two parts:
\[
m + 1 + m = 2m + 1
\]

### Case 2: \( k \) is odd
Let \( k = 2m + 1 \). Then:
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left\lfloor \frac{2m + 1 + 2^i}{2^{i+1}} \right\rfloor = 2m + 1
\]
We need to show:
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{k} \left\lfloor \frac{2m + 2 + 2^i}{2^{i+1}} \right\rfloor = 2m + 2
\]

For \( i = 0 \):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{2m + 2 + 2^0}{2^1} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{2m + 2 + 1}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{2m + 3}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor m + 1.5 \right\rfloor = m + 1
\]

For \( i \geq 1 \):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{2m + 2 + 2^i}{2^{i+1}} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{2m + 2^i + 2}{2^{i+1}} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{2m + 2^i}{2^{i+1}} + \frac{2}{2^{i+1}} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{2m + 2^i}{2^{i+1}} \right\rfloor
\]

Thus:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{k} \left\lfloor \frac{2m + 2 + 2^i}{2^{i+1}} \right\rfloor = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \left\lfloor \frac{2m + 2^i}{2^{i+1}} \right\rfloor = 2m - m = m
\]

Adding the two parts:
\[
m + 1 + m = 2m + 2
\]

Thus, by induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers \( n \).

d703050a-1133-57ba-9063-ef0f9f47ead6,proof,no,,no,yes,"1. **Define the problem and the sequence:**
   Let \( P(x) \) be a polynomial with integer coefficients such that \( P(0) = 1 \). Define the sequence \( \{x_n\} \) recursively by \( x_0 = 0 \) and \( x_{i+1} = P(x_i) \) for all integers \( i \geq 0 \). We need to show that there are infinitely many positive integers \( n \) such that \( \gcd(x_n, n+c) = 1 \) for a given integer \( c > 1 \).

2. **Introduce the property \( \mathcal{P}(P, c) \):**
   We say that \( \mathcal{P}(P, c) \) holds if there are infinitely many integers \( n \geq c \) such that \( \gcd(x_{n-c}, n) = 1 \).

3. **Simplify the problem:**
   We need to show that \( \mathcal{P}(P, c) \) holds for \( P(0) = 1 \) and \( c \geq 1 \).

4. **Consider the case when \( n \) is a prime number:**
   If \( n = p \) is a prime number, then \( \gcd(x_{p-c}, p) = 1 \) if and only if \( p \nmid x_{p-c} \). We need to find primes \( p \) such that \( p \nmid P(m) \) for all \( m \in \mathbb{Z} \).

5. **Use advanced theory for irreducible polynomials:**
   For irreducible polynomials \( P \), there are infinitely many primes \( p \) such that \( p \nmid P(m) \) for all \( m \in \mathbb{Z} \). This uses Galois theory and the Chebotarev density theorem.

6. **Consider polynomials with roots modulo all primes:**
   Some polynomials have roots modulo all primes or all but finitely many primes. For example, linear polynomials or polynomials like \( (x^2 + 1)(2x^2 + 1)(-2x^2 + 1) \).

7. **Use two values of \( n \) associated with \( p \):**
   To handle cases where \( p \mid x_n \) for some \( n \), we consider two values of \( n \) associated with \( p \). This helps in deducing strong restrictions on \( p \).

8. **Lemma 1:**
   - There is a unique number \( m = m(P, p) \geq 0 \) such that \( p \mid x_n \) if and only if \( m \mid n \).
   - If \( p \mid x_m \) and \( p \mid x_n \), then \( p \mid x_l \) whenever \( l \) is a multiple of \( \gcd(m, n) \).

9. **Lemma 2:**
   - If \( x_n \neq 0 \) and \( p^2 \mid x_n \), then \( v_p(x_{pn}) \leq v_p(x_n) + 1 \).

10. **Theorem 3:**
    - \( \mathcal{P}(P, c) \) holds except in the following cases:
      1. \( x_1 = 0 \).
      2. \( x_1 \) is even, \( x_2 = 0 \), and \( c \) is odd.
      3. \( P(x) = x + a \) with \( a \in \mathbb{Z} \) and \( c = 0 \).

11. **Proof of Theorem 3:**
    - If \( x_n = 0 \) for some \( n > 0 \), the sequence \( \{x_n\} \) is periodic with some minimal period \( m > 0 \). In cases (1) and (2), \( \mathcal{P}(P, c) \) does not hold.
    - If \( m = 2 \) and \( x_1 \) is odd or \( c \) is even, there will be infinitely many odd \( n \) such that \( n + c \) is coprime with \( x_1 = x_n \), so \( \mathcal{P}(P, c) \) holds.
    - If \( m \ge 3 \), there is \( j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, m-1\} \) such that \( \gcd(m, c+j) = 1 \). Then \( n = c + j + lm \) is always coprime with \( m \) for all \( l \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) and we can choose \( l \) so that \( \gcd(x_j, n) = 1 \).
    - If \( x_n \neq 0 \) for all \( n > 0 \), there are only finitely many primes dividing \( c \) or \( x_{|c-1|} \neq 0 \). If \( p \) is a prime that is not one of these exceptions, then \( \gcd(x_{n-c}, n) = 1 \) for at least one \( n \in \{p, p^2\} \).
    - If \( c = 1 \), assume for all but finitely many primes \( p \), \( p \mid x_{p-1} \). Let \( q \) be such a prime with \( q \nmid x_1x_2 \). Then \( m = m(P, q) \ge 3 \) and divides \( q-1 \). Let \( p \) be another prime such that \( p \nmid x_{q-1} \) and \( p \not\equiv 1 \mod m \). We claim that \( \gcd(x_{pq-1}, pq) = 1 \).
    - If \( c = 0 \), assume \( \mathcal{P}(P, 0) \) does not hold. This implies \( p \mid x_p \) for all but finitely many primes \( p \). Let \( a = x_1 = P(0) \neq 0 \) and define \( g(x) = a^{-1}P(ax) \in \mathbb{Z}[x] \). Define \( \{y_n\} \) as the iteration sequence for \( g \); then \( x_n = ay_n \) for all \( n \ge 0 \). For almost all primes \( p \), \( x_{p^e} \) is \( \pm a \) times a power of \( p \) for all \( e \ge 1 \). The sequence \( \{x_n\} \) must be unbounded. If \( d \ge 2 \), \( \{x_n\} \) grows too fast to be compatible with this. So the only possibilities are \( P(x) = x + a, a, -x + a \).

ab2643ea-ca4c-5b59-9721-ad68ddc65780,math-word-problem,no,,no,yes,"1. **Find the positive root of the quadratic equation:**
   The given equation is \( t^2 - 1998t - 1 = 0 \). To find the roots, we use the quadratic formula:
   \[
   t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -1998 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
   \[
   t = \frac{1998 \pm \sqrt{1998^2 + 4}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying further:
   \[
   t = \frac{1998 \pm \sqrt{3992004}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   t = \frac{1998 \pm 1998.001}{2}
   \]
   The positive root is:
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{1998 + 1998.001}{2} \approx 1998.0005
   \]

2. **Define the sequence and derive the recurrence relation:**
   The sequence is defined by \( x_0 = 1 \) and \( x_{n+1} = \lfloor \lambda x_n \rfloor \). We need to find the behavior of this sequence modulo 1998.

3. **Analyze the sequence modulo 1998:**
   We have:
   \[
   x_{n+1} = \lfloor \lambda x_n \rfloor
   \]
   Given \( \lambda \approx 1998 \), we can write:
   \[
   x_{n+1} \approx 1998 x_n
   \]
   Since we are interested in the sequence modulo 1998, we can simplify:
   \[
   x_{n+1} \equiv \lfloor 1998 x_n \rfloor \pmod{1998}
   \]
   Notice that:
   \[
   \lfloor 1998 x_n \rfloor \equiv 0 \pmod{1998}
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   x_{n+1} \equiv 0 \pmod{1998}
   \]

4. **Establish the periodicity and find \( x_{1998} \):**
   From the recurrence relation, we see that \( x_{n+1} \equiv x_{n-1} - 1 \pmod{1998} \). This suggests a periodic behavior. Specifically:
   \[
   x_{n+1} \equiv x_{n-1} - 1 \pmod{1998}
   \]
   Given \( x_0 = 1 \), we can compute the first few terms to identify the pattern:
   \[
   x_1 = \lfloor \lambda \cdot 1 \rfloor = 1998
   \]
   \[
   x_2 = \lfloor \lambda \cdot 1998 \rfloor \equiv 0 \pmod{1998}
   \]
   \[
   x_3 = \lfloor \lambda \cdot 0 \rfloor = 0
   \]
   \[
   x_4 = \lfloor \lambda \cdot 0 \rfloor = 0
   \]
   From this, we see that \( x_n \equiv 0 \pmod{1998} \) for \( n \geq 2 \).

5. **Conclusion:**
   Since \( x_n \equiv 0 \pmod{1998} \) for \( n \geq 2 \), it follows that:
   \[
   x_{1998} \equiv 0 \pmod{1998}
   \]

Notice that, $3102=2 \times 3 \times 11 \times 47$.
From $\underbrace{11 \cdots 1}_{n+1 \uparrow}=3102 k+1(k \in \mathbf{Z})$, we know $\underbrace{11 \cdots 10}_{n \uparrow}=3102 k$.
Thus, $\underbrace{11 \cdots 10}_{n \uparrow}$ is divisible by $2, 3, 11, 47$.
(1) For any positive integer $n$, obviously, $\underbrace{11 \cdots 10}_{n \uparrow}$ is divisible by 2;
(2) $\underbrace{11 \cdots 10}_{n \uparrow}$ is divisible by 3 if and only if $31 n$;
(3) $\underbrace{11 \cdots 10}_{n \uparrow}$ is divisible by 11 if and only if $2 \mid n$;

And $10 \equiv 10(\bmod 47)$,

Since $\frac{2}{3}$ of the apples are rotten, $\frac{3}{4}$ of the pears are rotten, and the number of rotten apples and pears are equal, then we could try 6 rotten pieces of each type of fruit. (We choose 6 as it is a multiple of the numerator of each fraction.)

If there are 6 rotten apples, then the total number of apples is $\frac{3}{2}(6)=9$.

If there are 6 rotten pears, then the total number of pears is $\frac{4}{3}(6)=8$.

Therefore, there are $9+8=17$ pieces of fruit in total, of which $6+6=12$ are rotten.

Thus, $\frac{12}{17}$ of the fruit are rotten.

## Solution 2

Suppose there are $a$ apples and $p$ pears in total.

Since the number of rotten apples and rotten pears are equal, then $\frac{2}{3} a=\frac{3}{4} p$, so $p=\frac{4}{3}\left(\frac{2}{3} a\right)=\frac{8}{9} a$.

Therefore, the total number of pieces of fruit is $a+p=a+\frac{8}{9} a=\frac{17}{9} a$.

Also, the total number of rotten fruit is $2\left(\frac{2}{3} a\right)=\frac{4}{3} a$, so the fraction of the total amount of fruit that is rotten is $\frac{\frac{4}{3} a}{\frac{17}{9} a}=\frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{9}{17}=\frac{12}{17}$.

fcd1b06a-de4e-52bb-9b44-f44ce84d8d9a,proof,no,,no,yes,"This is true even with $\mathbb{R}$ replaced by $\mathbb{C}$, and it will be necessary to work in this generality.
First solution using transformations. We will prove the claim in the following form:
Claim - Assume $P, Q \in \mathbb{C}[x]$ are relatively prime. If $\alpha P+\beta Q$ is a square for four different choices of the ratio $[\alpha: \beta]$ then $P$ and $Q$ must be constant.
Call pairs $(P, Q)$ as in the claim $b a d$; so we wish to show the only bad pairs are pairs of constant polynomials. Assume not, and take a bad pair with $\operatorname{deg} P+\operatorname{deg} Q$ minimal.

By a suitable Möbius transformation, we may transform $(P, Q)$ so that the four ratios are $[1: 0],[0: 1],[1:-1]$ and $[1:-k]$, so we find there are polynomials $A$ and $B$ such that
$$
\begin{aligned}
A^{2}-B^{2} & =C^{2} \\
A^{2}-k B^{2} & =D^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$
where $A^{2}=P+\lambda_{1} Q, B^{2}=P+\lambda_{2} Q$, say. Of course $\operatorname{gcd}(A, B)=1$.
Consequently, we have $C^{2}=(A+B)(A-B)$ and $D^{2}=(A+\mu B)(A-\mu B)$ where $\mu^{2}=k$. Now $\operatorname{gcd}(A, B)=1$, so $A+B, A-B, A+\mu B$ and $A-\mu B$ are squares; id est $(A, B)$ is bad. This is a contradiction, since $\operatorname{deg} A+\operatorname{deg} B\operatorname{deg}\left(Q^{\prime} P-Q P^{\prime}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

This can only occur if $Q^{\prime} P-Q P^{\prime}=0$ or $(P / Q)^{\prime}=0$ by the quotient rule! But $P / Q$ can't be constant, the end.
Remark. The result is previously known; see e.g. Lemma 1.6 of http://math.mit.edu/ $\sim$ ebelmont/ec-notes.pdf or Exercise 6.5.L(a) of Vakil's notes.","Let $P, Q \in \mathbb{R}[x]$ be relatively prime nonconstant polynomials.

Let $a_{1}=a$. Then $a_{2}=\frac{1}{1+a}, a_{3}=\frac{1+a}{2+a}, a_{4}=\frac{2+a}{3+2 a}, a_{5}=\frac{3+2 a}{5+3 a}, \ldots$. In general,

Thus, calculating $(p-1)!$ modulo $p$ amounts to:

- if $n \neq n^{-1}$, grouping each integer $n$ with its inverse $n^{-1}$ to multiply them, which produces only factors of 1 modulo $p$,
- otherwise, it means $n=1$ or $n=p-1$, which adds a factor of 1 and a factor of -1 modulo $p$.

fa979107-b48b-5563-944d-deda2b99e610,math-word-problem,no,,no,yes,"1. We start by analyzing the given equation:
   \[
   (x+1)^2 - xy(2x - xy + 2y) + (y+1)^2 = n
   \]
   Let \( a = xy - x - y \). Then we can rewrite the equation as:
   \[
   n = (x+1)^2 - xy(2x - xy + 2y) + (y+1)^2
   \]
   Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
   \[
   n = (xy - x - y)^2 - 2(xy - x - y - 1) + 2
   \]
   Substituting \( a \) into the equation, we have:
   \[
   n = a^2 - 2a + 2
   \]

2. Since \( a = xy - x - y \), we need to find the smallest \( n \) such that the number of ordered pairs \((x, y)\) satisfying \( a = xy - x - y \) is 61. 

3. Notice that \( a + 1 = (x-1)(y-1) \). Therefore, we need to find the smallest \( a \) such that \( a + 1 \) has exactly 61 divisors.

4. The number of divisors of a number is determined by its prime factorization. To have exactly 61 divisors, the number must be of the form \( p^{60} \), where \( p \) is a prime number. This is because the number of divisors of \( p^k \) is \( k + 1 \).

5. Therefore, the smallest \( a + 1 \) is \( 2^{60} \). Hence, \( a = 2^{60} - 1 \).

6. Substituting \( a = 2^{60} - 1 \) into the equation for \( n \), we get:
   \[
   n = (2^{60} - 1)^2 - 2(2^{60} - 1) + 2
   \]
   Simplifying this, we have:
   \[
   n = (2^{60} - 1)^2 - 2 \cdot 2^{60} + 2 + 2
   \]
   \[
   n = (2^{60} - 1)^2 - 2^{61} + 4
   \]
   \[
   n = 2^{120} - 2 \cdot 2^{60} + 1 - 2^{61} + 4
   \]
   \[
   n = 2^{120} - 2^{61} + 2
   \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{2^{120} - 2^{61} + 2}\).","Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $d(n)$ denote the number of ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ such that

If $\frac{m n-1}{m-n}=1$, rearranging gives $(m+1)(n-1)=0$.
Solving, we get $m=-1$ or $n=1$.
Therefore, when $n=1, m>1$, $\frac{m n-1}{m-n}=\frac{m-1}{m-1}=1$.
If $\frac{m n-1}{m-n}=2$, rearranging gives $(m+2)(n-2)=-3=3 \times(-1)$.
Solving, we get $m=1, n=1$.
But $m \neq n$, thus, $\frac{m n-1}{m-n} \neq 2$.
Therefore, 2 cannot be expressed as a number in the form $\frac{m n-1}{m-n}$. If $\frac{m n-1}{m-n}=a(a \in \mathbf{Z}, a>2)$, then $m n-a m+a n-1=0$. Hence, $(m+a)(n-a)=1-a^{2}=\left(a^{2}-1\right) \times(-1)$.

Travelling $x \mathrm{~km}$ at $120 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$ takes $\frac{x}{120}$ hours.

We are told that the difference between these lengths of time is 16 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, then 16 minutes is equivalent to $\frac{16}{60}$ hours.

Since the time at $120 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$ is 16 minutes less than the time at $90 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$, then $\frac{x}{90}-\frac{x}{120}=\frac{16}{60}$. Combining the fractions on the left side using a common denominator of $360=4 \times 90=3 \times 120$, we obtain $\frac{x}{90}-\frac{x}{120}=\frac{4 x}{360}-\frac{3 x}{360}=\frac{x}{360}$.

Thus, $\frac{x}{360}=\frac{16}{60}$.

Since $360=6 \times 60$, then $\frac{16}{60}=\frac{16 \times 6}{360}=\frac{96}{360}$. Thus, $\frac{x}{360}=\frac{96}{360}$ which means that $x=96$.

Consider the integer $m>1$, such that the sequence defined as described in the problem contains only perfect squares.
First, prove that $m-1$ is a power of 3.
Assume $m-1$ is even, then $a_{4}=5 m-1$ should be divisible by 4. Hence $m \equiv 1(\bmod 4)$.

But $a_{5}=5 m^{2}+3 m-1 \equiv 3(\bmod 4)$ cannot be a perfect square, a contradiction.
Thus, $m-1$ is odd.
Assume an odd prime $p \neq 3$ divides $m-1$.
Notice that, $a_{n}-a_{n-1} \equiv a_{n-2}-a_{n-3}(\bmod p)$.
Therefore, the sequence modulo $p$ takes the form 1, $1,4,4,7,7,10,10, \cdots$
In fact, by induction, it can be shown:
$a_{2 k} \equiv a_{2 k-1} \equiv 3 k-2(\bmod p)(k \geqslant 1)$.
Since $\operatorname{gcd}(p, 3)=1$, the sequence $a_{n}(\bmod p)$ contains all residues modulo $p$, which contradicts the fact that there are only $\frac{p+1}{2}$ quadratic residues modulo $p$.
This indicates that $m-1$ is a power of 3.
Let $h$ and $k$ be integers, satisfying:
$m=3^{k}+1, a_{4}=h^{2}$.
Then $5 \times 3^{k}=(h-2)(h+2)$.
Since $\operatorname{gcd}(h-2, h+2)=1$, we have
$$
\left\{\begin{array}{l}
h-2=1,3^{k}, 5, \\
h+2=5 \times 3^{k}, 5,3^{k} .
\end{array}\right.
$$

In the first two cases, we get $k=0$, and in the last case, we get $k=2$.
Thus, $m=2$ or 10.
Now, verify the converse.
Assume $m=2$ or 10, let $t=1$ or 3 such that
$$
m=t^{2}+1 \text {. }
$$

The integer sequence $b_{1}, b_{2}, \cdots$ is defined as follows:
$b_{1}=1, b_{2}=1, b_{3}=2$,
$b_{n}=t b_{n-1}+b_{n-2}(n \geqslant 4)$.
Clearly, for $n=1,2,3$, we have $a_{n}=b_{n}^{2}$.
Notice that, if $m=2$, then $a_{4}=9$ and $b_{4}=3$;
if $m=10$, then $a_{4}=49$ and $b_{4}=7$.
In both cases, we have $a_{4}=b_{4}^{2}$.
If $n \geqslant 5$, then
$b_{n}^{2}+b_{n-3}^{2}$
$=\left(t b_{n-1}+b_{n-2}\right)^{2}+\left(b_{n-1}-t b_{n-2}\right)^{2}$
$=\left(t^{2}+1\right)\left(b_{n-1}^{2}+b_{n-2}^{2}\right)$
$=m\left(b_{n-1}^{2}+b_{n-2}^{2}\right)$.
Therefore, by induction, it can be proven that for all $n \geqslant 1$, we have $a_{n}=b_{n}^{2}$.

a) Notice that for odd integers $n>2$, the tuple $(1,1, \ldots, 1)$ is expensive. We will prove that there are no expensive $n$-tuples for even $n$.

Lemma 0.1. If an expensive $n$-tuple exists for some $n \geq 4$, then also an expensive $n-2$-tuple.
Proof. In what follows all indices are considered modulo $n$. Let $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ be an expensive $n$-tuple and $a_{t}$ the largest element of the tuple. We have the inequalities

$$
\begin{aligned}
a_{t-1}+a_{t} & \leq 2 a_{t}<2\left(a_{t}+a_{t+1}\right) \\
a_{t}+a_{t+1} & \leq 2 a_{t}<2\left(a_{t-1}+a_{t}\right) .
\end{aligned}
$$

Since both $a_{t-1}+a_{t}$ and $a_{t}+a_{t+1}$ are powers of 2 (they are divisors of a power of 2), we deduce from (1) and (2)

$$
a_{t-1}+a_{t}=a_{t}+a_{t+1}=2^{r}
$$

for some positive integer $r$, and in particular $a_{t-1}=a_{t+1}$.
Consider now the $n-2$-tuple $\left(b_{1}, \ldots, b_{n-2}\right)$ obtained by removing $a_{t}$ and $a_{t+1}$ from $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$. By what we just said we have

$$
\prod_{i=1}^{n-2}\left(b_{i}+b_{i+1}\right)=\frac{\prod_{i=1}^{n}\left(a_{i}+a_{i+1}\right)}{\left(a_{t-1}+a_{t}\right)\left(a_{t}+a_{t+1}\right)}=2^{2(k-r)-1}
$$

and hence $\left(b_{1}, \ldots, b_{n-2}\right)$ is again expensive.
From the lemma we now conclude that if there exists an expensive $n$-tuple for some even $n$, then also an expensive 2-tuple i.e.

$$
\left(a_{1}+a_{2}\right)^{2}=2^{2 k-1}
$$

for some positive integers $a_{1}, a_{2}$, which is impossible since the right hand side is not a square.
b) We prove this by induction. In $a$) we saw that 1 belongs to an expensive $n$-tuple. Assume now that all odd positive integers less than $2^{k}$ belong to an expensive $n$-tuple, for some $k \geq 1$. Hence for any odd $r<2^{k}$ there is an integer $n$ and an expensive $n$-tuple $\left(a_{1}, \ldots, r, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$. We notice that then also ( $a_{1}, \ldots, r, 2^{k+1}-$ $\left.r, r, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ is expensive. Since $2^{k+1}-r$ can take all odd values between $2^{k}$ and $2^{k+1}$ the induction step is complete.","Let $n \geq 2$ be an integer.

4ff153a2-6244-51f6-8de9-47dd084000f9,math-word-problem,no,,no,yes,"IV /1. The roots of the polynomial $p(x)=x^{2}+a x+b$ are $x_{1}=\frac{-a+\sqrt{a^{2}-4 b}}{2}$ and $x_{2}=\frac{-a-\sqrt{a^{2}-4 b}}{2}$. Since they must be different, $a^{2}-4 b \neq 0$. From this, we calculate

$$
x_{1}^{2}-\frac{1}{2}=\frac{\left(a^{2}-2 b-1\right)-a \sqrt{a^{2}-4 b}}{2}
$$

and

$$
x_{2}^{2}-\frac{1}{2}=\frac{\left(a^{2}-2 b-1\right)+a \sqrt{a^{2}-4 b}}{2}
$$

Since these are the roots of the polynomial $q(x)$, they must satisfy the equation $x^{2}+\left(a-\frac{1}{2}\right) x+b^{2}-\frac{1}{2}=0$. When we substitute both into this equation and rearrange, we get

$$
\left(4 a^{4}-12 a^{2} b+8 b^{2}-5 a^{2}+6 b\right)-\left(4 a^{3}-4 a b-3 a\right) \sqrt{a^{2}-4 b}=0
$$

and

$$
\left(4 a^{4}-12 a^{2} b+8 b^{2}-5 a^{2}+6 b\right)+\left(4 a^{3}-4 a b-3 a\right) \sqrt{a^{2}-4 b}=0
$$

Thus, it must be that

$$
4 a^{4}-12 a^{2} b+8 b^{2}-5 a^{2}+6 b=0
$$

and

$$
\left(4 a^{3}-4 a b-3 a\right) \sqrt{a^{2}-4 b}=0
$$

Since $a^{2}-4 b \neq 0$, from the second equation it follows that $\left(4 a^{3}-4 a b-3 a\right)=a\left(4 a^{2}-4 b-3\right)=0$. If $a=0$, then from the first equation it follows that $8 b^{2}+6 b=2 b(4 b+3)=0$. Since $a^{2}-4 b \neq 0$, $b \neq 0$, so $b=-\frac{3}{4}$. If $a \neq 0$, then it must be that $4 a^{2}-4 b-3=0$ or $b=a^{2}-\frac{3}{4}$. When we substitute this into the first equation, we get $-2 a^{2}=0$ or $a=0$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $a=0$ and $b=-\frac{3}{4}$.

2. method. By Vieta's formulas, $x_{1}+x_{2}=-a, x_{1} x_{2}=b, x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}-1=\frac{1}{2}-a^{2}$ and $\left(x_{1}^{2}-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(x_{2}^{2}-\frac{1}{2}\right)=b^{2}-\frac{1}{2}$. First, let's rearrange the third equation, taking into account the first two,

$$
\frac{3}{2}-a^{2}=x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}=\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\right)^{2}-2 x_{1} x_{2}=a^{2}-2 b
$$

from which we get $b=a^{2}-\frac{3}{4}$. Now, let's rearrange the fourth equation,

$$
b^{2}-\frac{1}{2}=\left(x_{1}^{2}-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(x_{2}^{2}-\frac{1}{2}\right)=x_{1}^{2} x_{2}^{2}-\frac{1}{2}\left(x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}\right)+\frac{1}{4}=b^{2}-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{3}{2}-a^{2}\right)+\frac{1}{4}
$$

from which it follows that $a^{2}=0$ and thus $a=0$ and $b=-\frac{3}{4}$.

Rearranging, we get $a+8c=7b+4$ and $8a-c=7-4b$
Squaring both, $a^2+16ac+64c^2=49b^2+56b+16$ and $64a^2-16ac+c^2=16b^2-56b+49$ are obtained.
Adding the two equations and dividing by $65$ gives $a^2+c^2=b^2+1$, so $a^2-b^2+c^2=\boxed{(\text{B})1}$.

Solution 2
The easiest way is to assume a value for $a$ and then solve the system of equations. For $a = 1$, we get the equations 
$-7b + 8c = 3$ and
$4b - c = -1$
Multiplying the second equation by $8$, we have 
$32b - 8c = -8$
Adding up the two equations yields 
$25b = -5$, so $b = -\frac{1}{5}$
We obtain $c = \frac{1}{5}$ after plugging in the value for $b$.
Therefore, $a^2-b^2+c^2 = 1-\frac{1}{25}+\frac{1}{25}=\boxed{1}$ which corresponds to $\text{(B)}$.
This time-saving trick works only because we know that for any value of $a$, $a^2-b^2+c^2$ will always be constant (it's a contest), so any value of $a$ will work. This is also called [without loss of generality](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Without_loss_of_generality) or WLOG.

Solution 3 (fakesolve)
Notice that the coefficients of $a$ and $c$ are pretty similar (15s for reading and noticing), so let $b=0$ gives $a+8c=4$, and $8a-c=7$ (10s writing). Since the desired quantity simplifies to $a^2+c^2$, the $ac$ term of the quadratics after squaring gets canceled by adding up the squares of the two equations because they have the same coefficients but opposite sign (15s mind-binom). This simplifies to $65(a^2+c^2)=16+49$, or $a^2-b^2+c^2=\frac{65}{65}=\boxed{1}$(15s writing and addition and fraction simplification and (B) circling and submission)

This theorem was proven by Andrew Wiles in 1994.

2. **Case Analysis for \( n \geq z \)**:
   - Since \( n \geq z \), we need to consider the cases where \( n \) is 1, 2, or greater than 2.

3. **Case \( n = 1 \)**:
   - If \( n = 1 \), the equation becomes \( x + y = z \).
   - Since \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) are natural numbers, the smallest possible values for \( x \) and \( y \) are 1. Thus, \( x + y \geq 2 \).
   - Therefore, \( z \geq 2 \), which contradicts the requirement that \( n \geq z \) because \( n = 1 \) and \( z \geq 2 \).

4. **Case \( n = 2 \)**:
   - If \( n = 2 \), the equation becomes \( x^2 + y^2 = z^2 \).
   - This is the well-known Pythagorean theorem, which has solutions in natural numbers (e.g., \( 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2 \)).
   - However, since \( n \geq z \), we need \( z \leq 2 \). The only possible values for \( z \) are 1 or 2.
   - For \( z = 1 \), \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \) has no natural number solutions.
   - For \( z = 2 \), \( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \) also has no natural number solutions because the sum of two squares of natural numbers cannot equal 4.

5. **Case \( n > 2 \)**:
   - By Fermat's Last Theorem, there are no natural number solutions for \( x^n + y^n = z^n \) when \( n > 2 \).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Since there are no solutions for \( n = 1 \), \( n = 2 \), and \( n > 2 \), we conclude that the equation \( x^n + y^n = z^n \) does not hold for any natural numbers \( x \), \( y \), \( z \), and \( n \) with \( n \geq z \).

According to Viète's formulas, for the solutions $x_{1}, x_{2}$ of the given quadratic equation, we have

$$
x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}=\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\right)^{2}-2 x_{1} x_{2}=b^{2}-2 c
$$

Thus, we have $b^{2}-2 c=2$, which means $c=\frac{b^{2}-2}{2}$.

Notice that

$$
b+c=b+\frac{b^{2}-2}{2}=\frac{b^{2}+2 b-2}{2}=\frac{(b+1)^{2}-3}{2}
$$

The given equation has real solutions, so it is necessary that $b^{2}-4 c \geqslant 0$.

Since $c=\frac{b^{2}-2}{2}$, the condition $b^{2}-4 c \geqslant 0$ becomes $b^{2} \leqslant 4$, or $-2 \leqslant b \leqslant 2$.

From the condition $-2 \leqslant b \leqslant 2$, we sequentially get

$$
\begin{gathered}
-1 \leqslant b+1 \leqslant 3 \\
0 \leqslant(b+1)^{2} \leqslant 9 \\
-3 \leqslant(b+1)^{2}-3 \leqslant 6 \\
-\frac{3}{2} \leqslant \frac{(b+1)^{2}-3}{2} \leqslant 3
\end{gathered}
$$

Since $b+c=\frac{(b+1)^{2}-3}{2}$, we conclude that $b+c$ can take any value $u$ in the interval $\left[-\frac{3}{2}, 3\right]$.

First note that Carl ran $(35-22) \mathrm{m}=13 \mathrm{~m}$ while Bronwen ran $15 \mathrm{~m}$. Let the length of the race be $x \mathrm{~m}$. Since their speeds were constant, the ratio of the distances they ran in any time is also constant. Therefore, since Carl ran $(x-35) \mathrm{m}$ while Bronwen ran $(x-15) \mathrm{m}$, we have $\frac{x-35}{x-15}=\frac{13}{15}$. Therefore $15 x-15 \times 35=13 x-13 \times 15$ and hence $2 x=15 \times 35-13 \times 15$. Therefore $2 x=22 \times 15$ and hence $x=11 \times 15$.

Since the graph of the probability density function of the random variable $X$ is shown in Fig. 18, the area of the triangle $A B C$ must be equal to one. Using this condition, we will find the analytical expression for the function $f(x)$.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_22_c311c9dd990dc55c716eg-139.jpg?height=290&width=628&top_left_y=330&top_left_x=390)

Fig. 18

The area of $\triangle A B C$ is $S=\frac{1}{2} A C \cdot O B$; from this we get $O B=\frac{2 \cdot S}{A C}$. Since $S=1, A C=2 c$, then $O B=1 / c$.

The differential function of the distribution of the random variable $X$ for $x \in[-c ; c]$ is represented by two segments of straight lines. We will find the equations of these lines. We will look for each equation in the form of the equation of a straight line in segments on the axes:

$$
\frac{x}{a}+\frac{y}{b}=1
$$

where $a$ and $b$ are the segments cut off by the line on the $O x$ axis and the $O y$ axis, respectively; $x, y$ are the current coordinates.

For $-c \leq x \leq c$, the differential function of the random variable $X$ is 0.

Combining the obtained results, we will describe the probability density function of the random variable $X$ over the entire number line:

$$
f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & \text { if } & x < -c \\
\frac{1}{c}\left(1+\frac{x}{c}\right) & \text { if } & -c \leq x \leq 0 \\
\frac{1}{c}\left(1-\frac{x}{c}\right) & \text { if } & 0 < x \leq c \\
0 & \text { if } & x > c
\end{array}\right.
$$

The last expression can be written better:

$$
f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ccc}
\frac{1}{c}\left(1-\frac{|x|}{c}\right) & \text { if } & -c \leq x \leq c \\
0 & \text { if } & x < -c \text { or } x > c
\end{array}\right.
$$

b) The probability of the random variable $X$ falling into the interval $(-c / 2 ; c)$ can be found using formula (52). In this interval, for $x \in(-c / 2 ; 0)$ and for $x \in(0 ; c)$, the function $f(x)$ is described by two different equations, so the desired probability is

$$
P\left(-\frac{c}{2}<X<c\right)=\int_{-c / 2}^{0} \frac{1}{c}\left(1+\frac{x}{c}\right) d x+\int_{0}^{c} \frac{1}{c}\left(1-\frac{x}{c}\right) d x=\frac{7}{8}

# 18th Mathematics Knowledge Competition for Students of Secondary Technical and Vocational Schools

Preliminary Competition, March 15, 2018

## Solutions for Third Year

A competitor who arrives at the solution by any correct method (even if the scoring guide does not provide for it) receives all possible points.

A correct method is one that:

- sensibly takes into account the wording of the problem,
- leads to the solution of the problem,
- is mathematically correct and complete.

If an intermediate or final result can be recognized, guessed, read from a diagram, or calculated mentally, the competitor generally receives all the points provided for. However, if the solution is guessed (cannot be arrived at without calculation), and there is no written verification or proof, it is scored with 0 points.

A competitor who has only partially solved the problem, with correct procedures but no visible path to the final solution of the problem, cannot receive more than half of the possible points.

The mark ${ }^{\prime * \prime}$ next to the points means that the point or points can be awarded to the competitor for a correct procedure, even if the calculation is incorrect.

Consider the sequence of numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., 2019, 2020. Every third number in the given sequence is divisible by 3. Since $2020 = 3 \cdot 673 + 1$, it follows that there are 673 numbers in the sequence that are divisible by 3. Among these 673 numbers, every third one is divisible by $3^2$. Since $673 = 3 \cdot 224 + 1$, it follows that there are 224 such numbers. Proceeding similarly, we find how many numbers in the given sequence are divisible by $3^3, 3^4, 3^5$, etc. In the divisions performed, we only needed the quotients, which are the integer parts of the numbers $2020 \div 3, 2020 \div 3^2$, etc. Since $3^6 = 729$ and $3^7 = 2181$, we get $n = \left[\frac{2020}{3}\right] + \left[\frac{2020}{3^2}\right] + \left[\frac{2020}{3^3}\right] + \left[\frac{2020}{3^4}\right] + \left[\frac{2020}{3^5}\right] + \left[\frac{2020}{3^6}\right] = 673 + 224 + 74 + 24 + 8 + 2 = 1005$.

$$\begin{array}{l} 
f(a, b, c) - f(a, c, b) = a b^2 + b c^2 + c a^2 - (a c^2 + c b^2 + b a^2) = \\
a b(a - b) + c^2(a - b) + c(b^2 - a^2) = \\
(a - b)(a b + c^2 - a c - b c) = \\
(a - b)(a - c)(b - c) \geqslant 0
\end{array}$$

Thus, we only need to prove
$$f(a, b, c) + f(a, c, b) \leqslant \frac{27}{4}$$

And
$$\begin{aligned}
f(a, b, c) + f(a, c, b) = & a b^2 + b c^2 + c a^2 + (a c^2 + c b^2 + b a^2) = \\
& (a + b + c)(a b + b c + c a) - 3 a b c = \\
& 3(a b + b c + c a - a b c) = \\
& 3(a b + b c + c a - a b c - a - b - c + 3) = \\
& 3[(1 - a)(1 - b)(1 - c) + 2] = \\
& 3(1 - a)(1 - b)(1 - c) + 6
\end{aligned}$$

Therefore, we only need to prove
$$(1 - a)(1 - b)(1 - c) \leqslant \frac{1}{4}$$

If $1 \geqslant b \geqslant c \geqslant 0$, then $a \geqslant 1$, thus $(1 - a)(1 - b)(1 - c) \leqslant 0$.
If $a \geqslant b \geqslant 1$, then $c \leqslant 1$, then
$$\begin{array}{l}
(1 - a)(1 - b)(1 - c) = (a - 1)(b - 1)(1 - c) \leqslant \\
\left(\frac{(a - 1) + (b - 1)}{2}\right)^2(1 - c) \leqslant \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}
\end{array}$$

Thus, $f(a, b, c) + f(a, c, b) \leqslant \frac{27}{4}$, and since $f(a, b, c) \geqslant f(a, c, b)$, we have
$$f(a, b, c) = a b^2 + b c^2 + c a^2 \leqslant \frac{27}{8}$$

3948893b-e337-585c-a7d6-b0f5f6297a3c,proof,no,,no,yes,"1. **Base Cases:**
   We start by verifying the base cases given in the problem:
   \[
   d(n, 0) = d(n, n) = 0 \quad \text{for all} \quad n \geq 0.
   \]
   These are explicitly stated and do not require proof.

2. **Induction Hypothesis:**
   We will use mathematical induction to prove that \(d(n, m) = 0\) for all \(0 \leq m \leq n\). 

   **Base Case for Induction:**
   For \(m = 1\):
   \[
   d(n, 1) = d(n-1, 1) = \cdots = d(2, 1) = d(1, 1) = 0.
   \]
   Therefore, \(d(n, 1) = 0\).

3. **Inductive Step:**
   Assume that \(d(n, m) = 0\) for all \(0 \leq m \leq k\) and for all \(n \geq m\). We need to show that \(d(n, k+1) = 0\) for all \(n \geq k+1\).

   For \(m = k+1\), the recurrence relation is:
   \[
   (k+1)d(n, k+1) = (k+1)d(n-1, k+1) + (2n - (k+1))d(n-1, k).
   \]
   By the induction hypothesis, \(d(n-1, k) = 0\) for all \(n-1 \geq k\). Therefore:
   \[
   (k+1)d(n, k+1) = (k+1)d(n-1, k+1) + (2n - (k+1)) \cdot 0,
   \]
   which simplifies to:
   \[
   (k+1)d(n, k+1) = (k+1)d(n-1, k+1).
   \]
   Dividing both sides by \(k+1\) (which is non-zero), we get:
   \[
   d(n, k+1) = d(n-1, k+1).
   \]
   By repeatedly applying this relation, we get:
   \[
   d(n, k+1) = d(n-1, k+1) = d(n-2, k+1) = \cdots = d(k+1, k+1) = 0.
   \]
   Therefore, \(d(n, k+1) = 0\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   By induction, we have shown that \(d(n, m) = 0\) for all \(0 \leq m \leq n\).

\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \left( a + l \right) \]

where:
- \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) terms,
- \( n \) is the number of terms,
- \( a \) is the first term,
- \( l \) is the last term.

Given:
- The sequence has 2008 terms (\( n = 2008 \)).
- The first term (\( a \)) is not explicitly given, but we can infer it from the context.

Let's assume the sequence starts at \( a = -1776 \) and has a common difference \( d = 11 \).

1. **Find the last term \( l \):**
   The last term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula:
   \[ l = a + (n-1)d \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[ l = -1776 + (2008-1) \cdot 11 \]
   \[ l = -1776 + 2007 \cdot 11 \]
   \[ l = -1776 + 22077 \]
   \[ l = 20301 \]

2. **Calculate the sum \( S_{2008} \):**
   Using the sum formula for an arithmetic series:
   \[ S_{2008} = \frac{2008}{2} \left( -1776 + 20301 \right) \]
   \[ S_{2008} = 1004 \left( 18525 \right) \]
   \[ S_{2008} = 1004 \cdot 18525 \]
   \[ S_{2008} = 18599100 \]

Consider any quadratic equation with integer coefficients and the leading coefficient 1, which has two positive roots, the product of which is 1. For example, the equation $x^{2}-4 x+1$ has roots $2+\sqrt{3}$ and $2-\sqrt{3}$. Note that the sum and product of these roots are integers, and then the sum $(2+\sqrt{3})^{n}+(2-\sqrt{3})^{n}$ is an integer for any natural $n$ (this is not difficult to prove by induction or simply by expanding the brackets: terms with $\sqrt{3}$ either enter in an even power or cancel each other out).

Then $\left((2+\sqrt{3})^{n}+(2-\sqrt{3})^{n}\right)^{2}-$ is a perfect square, and it equals $(2+\sqrt{3})^{2 n}+2+(2-\sqrt{3})^{2 n}$ (since the product of the roots is 1), which is 2 away from the number $(2+\sqrt{3})^{2 n}+(2-\sqrt{3})^{2 n}$, which, in turn, is the upper integer part of the number $(2+\sqrt{3})^{2 n}$ (since the second root is positive and less than 1).

But then the number $A=(2+\sqrt{3})^{2}$ is the desired one.

Comment. It is not difficult to see that for $t$ we can take any number that is the larger root of a polynomial of the form $x^{2}-n x+1=0$, where $n$ is a natural number not less than 3. Indeed, as in the solution above, the sum of the roots $t^{n}+\frac{1}{t^{n}}$ of this polynomial turns out to be an integer, from which for $A=t^{2}$ the statement of the problem follows.

In this solution, we see that for the numbers we have taken, the distance from the power $t^{n}$ to the nearest integer tends to zero as $t$ increases. In fact, there are more numbers whose powers become closer and closer to integers (but we cannot say that they fit for solving this problem!).

Namely, let $P(x)$ be a monic polynomial with integer coefficients, all of whose roots (including complex ones), except one, are less than 1 in absolute value. Then this root $x_{1}$ is real, and the distance from $x_{1}^{n}$ to the nearest integer tends to 0 as $n$ increases. This follows from the fact that the sum of the $n$-th powers of all the roots of the polynomial $P(x)$ is expressed as an integer through its coefficients, and is therefore an integer. And the powers of all other roots tend to 0 - precisely because they are less than 1 in absolute value. This reasoning can be found in the article by A. Egorov “Pisot Numbers” (journal “Kvant”, issues 5 and 6 for 2005); see also the project “Fractional Parts of Powers” at the XII Summer Conference of the Tournament of Towns.

Such numbers - roots of a monic polynomial with integer coefficients, all other roots of which are less than 1 in absolute value - are called Pisot numbers or Pisot-Vijayaraghavan numbers. They are of interest in connection with Diophantine approximation problems and have been studied in the works of Thue, Hardy, Pisot (see, for example, the book: J. W. S. Cassels. Introduction to Diophantine Approximations. Moscow: IL, 1961. [Chapter VIII]).

These numbers received their name after the publication of Charles Pisot, who discovered many remarkable properties of these numbers in his dissertation.","6.

(1) $\frac{\cos (C-B)}{\cos A}=\frac{2 \cos (C-B) \sin A}{2 \cos A \sin A}=\frac{2 \cos (C-B) \sin (C+B)}{2 \cos A \sin A}=\frac{\sin 2 B+\sin 2 C}{\sin 2 A}$.

Similarly, $\frac{\cos (A-C)}{\cos B}=\frac{\sin 2 C+\sin 2 A}{\sin 2 B}, \frac{\cos (B-A)}{\cos C}=\frac{\sin 2 A+\sin 2 B}{\sin 2 C}$.
Therefore, $\frac{\cos (C-B)}{\cos A} \cdot \frac{\cos (A-C)}{\cos B} \cdot \frac{\cos (B-A)}{\cos C}$
$$
=\frac{(\sin 2 A+\sin 2 B)(\sin 2 B+\sin 2 C)(\sin 2 C+\sin 2 A)}{\sin 2 A+\sin 2 B+\sin 2 C} \text {. }
$$
(2) Method 1 From (1), we know that $\frac{\cos (C-B)}{\cos A}=\frac{\sin 2 B+\sin 2 C}{\sin 2 A} \geqslant \frac{2 \sqrt{\sin 2 B \cdot \sin 2 C}}{\sin 2 A}$.

Similarly, $\frac{\cos (A-C)}{\cos B} \geqslant \frac{2 \sqrt{\sin 2 C \cdot \sin 2 A}}{\sin 2 B}, \frac{\cos (B-A)}{\cos C} \geqslant \frac{2 \sqrt{\sin 2 A \cdot \sin 2 B}}{\sin 2 C}$.
Therefore, $\frac{\cos (C-B)}{\cos A} \cdot \frac{\cos (A-C)}{\cos B} \cdot \frac{\cos (B-A)}{\cos C}$
$\geqslant \frac{2 \sqrt{\sin 2 B \sin 2 C}}{\sin 2 A} \cdot \frac{2 \sqrt{\sin 2 C \sin 2 A}}{\sin 2 B} \cdot \frac{2 \sqrt{\sin 2 A \sin 2 B}}{\sin 2 C}=8$.
Method 2 $\frac{\cos (C-B)}{\cos A}=-\frac{\cos (C-B)}{\cos (B+C)}=\frac{\cos B \cos C+\sin B \sin C}{-\cos B \cos C+\sin B \sin C}=\frac{1+\tan B \tan C}{\tan B \tan C-1}$.
Similarly, $\frac{\cos (A-C)}{\cos B}=\frac{1+\tan C \tan A}{\tan C \tan A-1}, \frac{\cos (B-A)}{\cos C}=\frac{1+\tan A \tan B}{\tan A \tan B-1}$.
Since in $\triangle A B C$ we have $\tan A+\tan B+\tan C=\tan A \tan B \tan C$,
i.e., $\frac{1}{\tan A \tan B}+\frac{1}{\tan B \tan C}+\frac{1}{\tan C \tan A}=1$.
Let $x=\frac{1}{\tan A \tan B}, y=\frac{1}{\tan B \tan C}, z=\frac{1}{\tan C \tan A}$, then
the original inequality is equivalent to: $x, y, z>0, x+y+z=1$, prove: $\frac{1+\frac{1}{x}}{\frac{1}{x}-1} \cdot \frac{1+\frac{1}{y}}{\frac{1}{y}-1} \cdot \frac{1+\frac{1}{z}}{\frac{1}{z}-1} \geqslant 8$.
Since $\frac{1+\frac{1}{x}}{\frac{1}{x}-1}=\frac{x+1}{1-x}=\frac{x+(x+y+z)}{(x+y+z)-x}=\frac{(x+y)+(z+x)}{y+z} \geqslant \frac{2 \sqrt{(x+y)(y+z)}}{y+z}$.
Similarly, $\frac{1+\frac{1}{y}}{\frac{1}{y}-1} \geqslant \frac{2 \sqrt{(x+y)(y+z)}}{z+x}, \frac{1+\frac{1}{z}}{\frac{1}{z}-1} \geqslant \frac{2 \sqrt{(y+z)(z+x)}}{x+y}$,
Therefore, $\frac{1+\frac{1}{x}}{\frac{1}{x}-1} \cdot \frac{1+\frac{1}{y}}{\frac{1}{y}-1} \cdot \frac{1+\frac{1}{z}}{\frac{1}{z}-1}$
$\geqslant \frac{2 \sqrt{(x+y)(z+x)} \cdot 2 \sqrt{(x+y)(y+z)} \cdot 2 \sqrt{(y+z)(z+x)}}{(y+z) \cdot(z+x)(x+y)}=8$.
Thus, we have proved the original inequality.","Note: In an acute $\triangle ABC$, prove:

For any integer $k$, let $\Delta_{k}=f(k+1)-f(k)$. Then

$$
\Delta_{k+1}=f(k+2)-f(k+1)=(f(k+1)+f(k)) / 2-f(k+1)=-\Delta_{k} / 2
$$

and, conversely, $\Delta_{k-1}=-2 \Delta_{k}$. An immediate induction then shows that $\Delta_{n-k}=(-2)^{k} \varepsilon$ for all $k \geqslant 0$.

However, for any integer $k$, we know that $|\Delta_{k}| \leqslant |f(k+1)|+|f(k)| \leqslant 2 \mathbf{F}$. But this is incompatible with the fact that $|\Delta_{n-k}|=2^{k}|\mathcal{E}|$ for all $k \geqslant 0$. Our initial assumption was therefore absurd, and $f$ is indeed constant.

a) It is enough to use the given equation for $n=2, n=3$, and $n=4$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
x_{2}=x_{1}+\frac{1}{x_{1}^{2}}=1+\frac{1}{1^{2}}=2 \\
x_{3}=x_{2}+\frac{1}{x_{2}^{2}}=2+\frac{1}{2^{2}}=\frac{9}{4} \\
x_{4}=x_{3}+\frac{1}{x_{3}^{2}}=\frac{9}{4}+\frac{1}{\left(\frac{9}{4}\right)^{2}}=\frac{793}{324}
\end{gathered}
$$

b) For any $n$, if $x_{n-1} \neq 0$, then $x_{n-1}^{2}>0$ and $\frac{1}{x_{n-1}^{2}}>0$, because the square of any non-zero real number is positive. Thus,

$$
\begin{aligned}
x_{n} & =x_{n-1}+\frac{1}{x_{n-1}^{2}} \\
& >x_{n-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $x_{1}=1>0$, by the previous argument, we have $x_{2}>x_{1}>0$. Now, using $x_{2}$ in the role of $x_{1}$ in the previous argument, we have $x_{3}>x_{2}>0$. Notice that we can continue repeating the argument, now with $x_{3}$ in the role of $x_{2}$. This inductive process allows us to conclude that the sequence is strictly increasing.

c) Raising the recurrence equation to the third power, we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
x_{n}^{3} & =\left(x_{n-1}+\frac{1}{x_{n-1}^{2}}\right)^{3} \\
& =x_{n-1}^{3}+3 x_{n-1}^{2} \frac{1}{x_{n-1}^{2}}+3 x_{n-1} \frac{1}{x_{n-1}^{4}}+\frac{1}{x_{n-1}^{6}} \\
& >x_{n-1}^{3}+3
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore,

$$
y_{n}=x_{n}^{3}>x_{n-1}^{3}+3=y_{n-1}+3
$$

d) The idea now is to use the growth of $y_{n}$ to reach some conclusion about the growth of $x_{n}$. We have $x_{n}>2016$ if and only if $y_{n}=x_{n}^{3}>2016^{3}$. In the previous item, we proved that $y_{n}>y_{n-1}+3$ for all $n \geq 2$. Successive applications of this inequality allow us to conclude that:

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_{n} & >y_{n-1}+3 \\
& >y_{n-2}+6 \\
& >y_{n-3}+9 \\
& \cdots \\
& >y_{1}+3(n-1) \\
& =3 n-2
\end{aligned}
$$

Well, now it is enough to take $N$ that satisfies $3 N-2>2016^{3}$, that is, $N>\frac{2016^{3}+2}{3}$. We can take $N=2016^{3}$, for example, since this number satisfies the inequality. For this value of $N$, the term $x_{N}$ of the sequence will be greater than 2016.","A sequence of real numbers $x_{n}$ is an ordered list of reals where the first number in the list is the term $x_{1}$, the second is the term $x_{2}$, and so on. For example, the usual sequence of positive integers can be described as $x_{n}=n$ for every positive integer $n$. Some sequences can be defined by recurrence equations, where a term is defined in terms of its predecessors.

For example, the sequence of positive integers could be defined by $x_{1}=1$ and $x_{n}=x_{n-1}+1$ for every positive integer $n \geq 2$. In this way, we could calculate $x_{2}=1+1=2$, $x_{3}=2+1=3$, and so on.

Consider a sequence of real numbers defined by $x_{1}=1$ and $x_{n}=x_{n-1}+\frac{1}{x_{n-1}^{2}}$ for every positive integer $n \geq 2$.

a) Calculate $x_{2}, x_{3}$, and $x_{4}$.

b) Verify that the sequence is strictly increasing, that is, that $x_{n}>x_{n-1}$ for every positive integer $n$.

c) Notice that the sequence seems to grow very little. After calculating some initial terms, we might suspect that no term exceeds 2016, but in fact, we will prove that there are terms greater than 2016. For this, we will use the auxiliary sequence $y_{n}=x_{n}^{3}$. Prove that $y_{n}>y_{n-1}+3$ for every $n \geq 2$.

/- A sequence of real numbers $x_{n}$ is an ordered list of reals where the first number in the list is the term $x_{1}$, the second is the term $x_{2}$, and so on. For example, the usual sequence of positive integers can be described as $x_{n}=n$ for every positive integer $n$. Some sequences can be defined by recurrence equations, where a term is defined in terms of its predecessors.

For example, the sequence of positive integers could be defined by $x_{1}=1$ and $x_{n}=x_{n-1}+1$ for every positive integer $n \geq 2$. In this way, we could calculate $x_{2}=1+1=2$, $x_{3}=2+1=3$, and so on.

Consider a sequence of real numbers defined by $x_{1}=1$ and $x_{n}=x_{n-1}+\frac{1}{x_{n-1}^{2}}$ for every positive integer $n \geq 2$.

a) Calculate $x_{2}, x_{3}$, and $x_{4}$.

b) Verify that the sequence is strictly increasing, that is, that $x_{n}>x_{n-1}$ for every positive integer $n$.

c) Notice that the sequence seems to grow very little. After calculating some initial terms, we might suspect that no term exceeds 2016, but in fact, we will prove that there are terms greater than 2016. For this, we will use the auxiliary sequence $y_{n}=x_{n}^{3}$. Prove that $y_{n}>y_{n-1}+3$ for every $n \geq 2$.
d) Prove that there exists a number $N$ such that $x_{N}>2016$. -/

Thus, the function $y(x)$ increases on the interval $[-2 ; 2]$, and decreases on the intervals $(-\infty ;-2]$ and $[2 ;+\infty)$.

The maximum value of the function is attained at $x=2$.

$$
y(2)=\frac{2}{4+4}=\frac{1}{4}
$$

Method II. We will find the maximum value of the function $y$ experimentally. Let's find several values of the given function for $x \geqslant 0$ (since the maximum value of the function $y$ is achieved for $x \geqslant 0$):

$$
y(0)=0, y(1)=\frac{1}{5}, y(2)=\frac{1}{4}, y(3)=\frac{3}{10}, y(4)=\frac{1}{5}
$$

Among the found values of $y$, the largest is $\frac{1}{4}$. We will prove that $\frac{1}{4}$ is the maximum value of the function over its entire domain, i.e., we will prove that for all $x$ the inequality $\frac{x}{x^{2}+4} \leqslant \frac{1}{4}$ holds.

We have $4 x \leqslant x^{2}+4$, from which $x^{2}-4 x+4 \geqslant 0$. We obtained the obvious inequality $(x-2)^{2} \geqslant 0$. The statement is proved.

Answer: $\frac{1}{4}$.

Let $d$ be a divisor of $n$, i.e., $d \mid n$, then we have
$d \equiv 1$ or $2(\bmod 3)$,
$d \equiv 1,3,5$ or $7(\bmod 8)$.
From $d \cdot \frac{n}{d}=n \equiv-1(\bmod 3)$ or $(\bmod 8)$, we know that there are only the following possibilities:
$$
\begin{array}{l}
d \equiv 1, \frac{n}{d} \equiv 2(\bmod 3), \\
d \equiv 1, \frac{n}{d} \equiv 7(\bmod 8), \\
d \equiv 3, \frac{n}{d} \equiv 5(\bmod 8) .
\end{array}
$$

Conversely, the above three congruences also imply
$n \equiv-1(\bmod 3)$ or $(\bmod 8)$.
Thus, we have $d+\frac{n}{d} \equiv 0(\bmod 3), d+\frac{n}{d} \equiv 0(\bmod 8)$, which means
$$
d+\frac{n}{d} \equiv 0(\bmod 24) \text {. }
$$

Therefore, for $n \equiv-1(\bmod 3)$, $n$ is not a perfect square, so $d \neq \frac{n}{d}$, meaning that the divisors of $n$ are all distinct.

$$
(10 a+b) 10^{s-2} \leqslant n < (10 a+b+1) 10^{s-2}
$$

Since $f(n) \leqslant 9 s$, we have $k \leqslant 9 s / 10^{s-1}$. For $s \geqslant 3$, we have $9 s / 10^{s-1} < 1$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $s=2$. Then, $10 a+b \leqslant n < 10 a+b+1$, and $f(n) = a + b$. Thus, we have:

$$
10 a + b = k (a + b)
$$

Rearranging, we get:

$$
(10 - k) a = (k - 1) b
$$

For $k > 10$, we have $(10 - k) a < 0$, which is a contradiction. For $k > 4$, we have $10 k - 1 > (10 - k) 9 + 1$, which contradicts the right inequality. Therefore, $k \leqslant 4$. An example for $k=1$ is $n=11$. For $k=2$, we have $8 a - 20$; however, then the first non-zero digit from the right in the number $B$ on the right side of the equation is 9, while on the left side it is 0, a contradiction. Thus, finally, we cannot find a corresponding $n$ for $k=4$.

Now consider the case $b=0$. From the above inequality, we have $10 - 2 k \leqslant (10 - k) a - k < 0 < (10 - k) a + 1 \leqslant 91 - 9 k$, so $k \in \{6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}$. For $k=6, 7, 9, 10$, we have examples, respectively, $n=108, 105, 405, 10$. Suppose now $k=8$. Then we have $2 a - 8 < 0$, so $a \in \{1, 2, 3\}$. Also, $s \geqslant 3$, because for numbers $\overline{a 0}$, we have $\frac{\overline{a 0}}{f(\overline{a 0})} = \frac{\overline{a 0}}{a} = 10$. Define the numbers $x, A$, and $B$ similarly as in the previous paragraph ($x$ is obtained by replacing all occurrences of the digit $a$ with 0, $A$ is obtained by replacing all occurrences of the digit $a$ with 1 and all other digits with 0, and $B$ is obtained by replacing all occurrences of the digit 0 with 1 and all other digits with 0, all in the number $n$ with the first two digits removed). Then we have $n = a 10^{s-1} + a A + x$ and $f(n) = a 10^{s-2} + a B + x$, so the condition $n = 8 f(n)$ reduces to

$$
2 a 10^{s-2} + a A = 8 a B + 7 x
$$

Suppose $n$ ends in the digit 0. Then, by the definition of the numbers $x, A$, and $B$, we have $10 \mid x, A$ and $10 \nmid B$, but this is a contradiction with the above equality (all terms except $8 a B$ are divisible by 10, and $8 a B$ is not because $B$ ends in the digit 1 and $a \in \{1, 2, 3\}$). Suppose now that $n$ ends in the digit $a$. Then we have $10 \mid x, B$ and $10 \nmid A$, which is again a contradiction with the above equality because $10 \nmid a A$. Finally, suppose $n$ ends in a digit different from 0 and $a$. Then we have $10 \mid A, B$ and $10 \nmid x$, and again a contradiction. Therefore, there are no solutions for $k=8$.

In conclusion, the only values of the expression $\frac{n}{f(n)}$ in the set of natural numbers are: $1, 6, 7, 9$, and 10.

\Rightarrow \sum \frac{1}{1+2 a}=1,

$$

where, "" $\Pi $"" is the cyclic symmetric product.
Thus, it suffices to prove
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\frac{1}{(1+a)+b}+\frac{1}{(1+b)+c}+\frac{1}{(1+c)+a} \\
\leqslant \frac{1}{(1+a)+a}+\frac{1}{(1+b)+b}+\frac{1}{(1+c)+c} .
\end{array}
$$

Without loss of generality, assume $a \geqslant b \geqslant c$. Then
$$
1+a \geqslant 1+b \geqslant 1+c \text {. }
$$

It suffices to prove the following lemma.
Lemma: Suppose
$$
0<x_{1} \leqslant x_{2} \leqslant \cdots \leqslant x_{n}, 0<y_{1} \leqslant y_{2} \leqslant \cdots \leqslant y_{n} \text {. }
$$

Then for any permutation $y_{t_{1}} \sim y_{t_{n}}$ of $y_{1} \sim y_{n}$, we have
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{y_{t_{i}}+x_{i}} \leqslant \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{y_{i}+x_{i}} \text {. }
$$

It suffices to prove: When $y_{t_{i}} \geqslant y_{t_{j}}, x_{i} \leqslant x_{j}$, we have
$$
\frac{1}{y_{t_{i}}+x_{i}}+\frac{1}{y_{t_{j}}+x_{j}} \leqslant \frac{1}{y_{t_{i}}+x_{j}}+\frac{1}{y_{t_{j}}+x_{i}} \text {. }
$$

By swapping the values of $t_{i}$ and $t_{j}$, and gradually swapping, we can adjust the sequence $t_{1} \sim t_{n}$ to $\mathrm{I} \sim n$. Thus,
the left side of (1) $\leqslant$ the right side of (1).
And (2)
$$
\Leftrightarrow \frac{y_{t_{j}}-y_{t_{i}}}{\left(y_{t_{i}}+x_{i}\right)\left(y_{t_{j}}+x_{i}\right)} \leqslant \frac{y_{t_{j}}-y_{t_{i}}}{\left(y_{t_{i}}+x_{j}\right)\left(y_{t_{j}}+x_{j}\right)} .
$$

By $x_{j} \geqslant x_{i}$, we get
$$
\left(y_{t_{i}}+x_{j}\right)\left(y_{t_{j}}+x_{j}\right) \geqslant\left(y_{t_{i}}+x_{i}\right)\left(y_{t_{j}}+x_{i}\right) \geqslant 0 \text {. }
$$

Since $y_{t_{j}}-y_{t_{i}} \leqslant 0$, (3) holds.
Thus, the original inequality holds.","9. (16 points) Let $a, b, c \in \mathbf{R}_{+}$, and $1+a+b+c=4abc$. Prove:

Summing the above equation from 0 to $v-1$, we get $g(v+1)-g(v)=\frac{1}{15^{2}}\left[1-(15 v+1) \cdot 16^{-v}\right]$. Summing again (from 0 to $v-1$) gives $g(v)=\frac{1}{15^{3}}\left[15 v-32+(15 v+2) \cdot 16^{-v+1}\right]$, thus $f(v)=\frac{1}{15^{3}}\left[15 v+2+(15 v-32) \cdot 16^{v-1}\right] \cdot 2^{(v-2)^{2}} \quad (v=0,1,2, \cdots)$.

Therefore the region of the $x y$-plane within which we have $x^{3} y^{2}-x^{2} y^{2}-x y^{4}+x y^{3} \geq 0$ and $0 \leq x \leq y$ is the region where $x+y-1 \leq 0$ and $0 \leq x \leq y$.

Therefore the region whose area we need to find is the triangle $O P Q$ which is bounded by the lines with equations $x=0, x=y$ and $y=1-x$, as shown in the diagram.
The point $O$ is the origin where the lines $x=0$ and $y=x$ meet. The point $P$ is the point where the lines $x=0$ and $y=1-x$ meet. The co-ordinates of $P$ are $(0,1)$.

In the creation of 40 problems, 30 students from all five years of study participated. Every two students from the same year came up with the same number of problems. Every two students from different years came up with a different number of problems. How many people came up with exactly one problem?

## Solution

Let's choose five students, one from each year. Since the number of problems they came up with is different, these students came up with at least \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15\) problems. Then the remaining 25 students came up with no more than \(40 - 15 = 25\) problems. That is, each of them came up with exactly one problem, and among the selected students, one came up with one problem, so in total, 26 people came up with exactly one problem. This is indeed possible. For example, each student came up with as many problems as the number of their year, and 26 students from the first year participated, while one student from each of the other years participated.

Below, we prove that in the interval $\left(-\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{4}\right)$, the function $f(x)=\arctan \frac{2-2 x}{1+4 x}-\arctan 2$ is an odd function, i.e., it satisfies the relation: $f(x)=-f(-x)$.

Let $z=\frac{2-2 x}{1+4 x}$, it is easy to see that $z=-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{5}{2(1+4 x)}$. When $-\frac{1}{4}<x<\frac{1}{4}$, we have $z>0$. When $x=0$, $z=2$; when $x=\frac{1}{4}$, $z=\frac{3}{4}$. Therefore, $\arctan \frac{3}{4}<\arctan z<\frac{\pi}{2}, \arctan \frac{3}{4}-\arctan 2<\arctan z-\arctan 2<\frac{\pi}{2}-$ $\arctan 2$. Hence, (1) is equivalent to
$$
\tan f(x)=\tan (-f(-x)).

But by the trigonometric formula, we get $\tan f(x)=-2 x, \tan [-f(-x)]=-2 x$, so (2) holds, and thus (1) is established.

(1) First, prove that these values of $P(0)$ can be achieved.

For each negative real number $-C$, the polynomial
$$
P(x)=-\left(\frac{2 x^{2}}{C}+C\right)
$$

satisfies $P(0)=-C$.
To prove that $P(x)$ satisfies the required properties in the problem, by symmetry, it suffices to prove that for each $C>0$ and any two real numbers $x, y$, we have
$$
\left|y^{2}-P(x)\right|>2|x| \text {. }
$$

In fact,
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\left|y^{2}-P(x)\right|=y^{2}+\frac{x^{2}}{C}+\frac{(|x|-C)^{2}}{C}+2|x| \\
\geqslant \frac{x^{2}}{C}+2|x| \geqslant 2|x| .
\end{array}
$$

Note that the first inequality holds only when $|x|=C$, and the second inequality holds only when $x=0$. Since these two conditions cannot hold simultaneously, then
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\left|y^{2}-P(x)\right|>2|x| \text {. } \\
\text { The polynomial } P(x)=x^{2}+1 \text { satisfies } P(0)=1 . \\
\text { Now prove: } P(x) \text { satisfies (1) and (2). } \\
\text { Note that, for all real numbers } x, y \text {, we have } \\
\left|y^{2}-P(x)\right| \leqslant 2|x| \\
\Leftrightarrow\left(y^{2}-x^{2}-1\right)^{2} \leqslant 4 x^{2} \\
\Leftrightarrow 0 \leqslant\left[y^{2}-(x-1)^{2}\right]\left[(x+1)^{2}-y^{2}\right] \\
\Leftrightarrow 0 \leqslant(y-x+1)(y+x-1)(x+1-y)(x+1+y) \\
\Leftrightarrow 0 \leqslant\left[(x+y)^{2}-1\right]\left[1-(x-y)^{2}\right] .
\end{array}
$$

Since the above inequality is symmetric in $x, y$, it is also equivalent to
$$
\left|x^{2}-P(y)\right| \leqslant 2|y| \text {. }
$$
(2) Next, prove that $P(0)$ cannot take any other values.

To prove this, assume $P(x)$ satisfies (1), and $P(0) \geqslant 0$.
We will prove in four steps that for all real numbers $x$, we have
$$
P(x)=x^{2}+1 \Rightarrow P(0)=1 \text {. }
$$

【Step 1】 $P(x)$ is an even function.
From (1) and (2), we know that for any real numbers $x, y$,
$$
\left|y^{2}-P(x)\right| \leqslant 2|x|
$$
$\Leftrightarrow\left|x^{2}-P(y)\right| \leqslant 2|y|$
$$
\Leftrightarrow\left|y^{2}-P(-x)\right| \leqslant 2|x| \text {. }
$$

Considering that the first inequality is equivalent to the third inequality and $y^{2}$ takes values in $\mathbf{R} \backslash \mathbf{R}_{-}$, then for all $x \in \mathbf{R}$, we have $[P(x)-2|x|, P(x)+2|x|] \cap \mathbf{R} \backslash \mathbf{R}_{-}$ $=[P(-x)-2|x|, P(-x)+2|x|] \cap \mathbf{R} \backslash \mathbf{R}_{-}$. We will prove: there are infinitely many real numbers $x$ such that
$$
P(x)+2|x| \geqslant 0 \text {. }
$$

In fact, for any real-coefficient polynomial satisfying $P(0) \geqslant 0$, the conclusion holds. For this, assume the coefficient of $x$ in $P(x)$ is non-negative. In this case, for sufficiently small positive real numbers $x$, the conclusion holds.

For the real numbers $x$ satisfying $P(x)+2|x| \geqslant 0$, we have
$$
\begin{array}{l}
P(x)+2|x|=P(-x)+2|x| \\
\Rightarrow P(x)=P(-x) .
\end{array}
$$

Since the polynomial $P(x)-P(-x)$ has infinitely many zeros, it is identically zero, i.e., $P(x)=P(-x)$ for all real numbers $x$.
Therefore, $P(x)$ is an even function.
【Step 2】 For all $t \in \mathbf{R}$, $P(t)>0$.
Assume there exists a real number $t \neq 0$ such that $P(t)=0$. Then there exists an open interval $I$ such that for all $y \in I$, we have
$|P(y)| \leqslant 2|y|$.
Taking $x=0$ in (1), then for all $y \in I$ we have $y^{2}=P(0)$, which is a contradiction.
$\left|\left(1-a^{2}\right) x^{2}-b\right| \leqslant 2 \sqrt{a} x$.
By $a>0$, we know that it only holds when $a=1$.
Taking $y=x+1(x>0)$ in (1), then
$|2 x+1-b| \leqslant 2 x$
$$
\Leftrightarrow|2 x+1+b| \leqslant 2 x+2 \text {, }
$$

i.e., for all $x>0$,
$b \in[1,4 x+1] \Leftrightarrow b \in[-4 x-3,1]$. This is only possible when $b=1$.
Thus, $P(x)=x^{2}+1$.","5. Consider all real-coefficient polynomials $P(x)$ that satisfy the following property: for any two real numbers $x, y$, we have

Indeed, when $a$ is a single-digit number, $f(1)=1$, the proposition holds; assuming the proposition holds for an $n$-digit number $a$, i.e.,
when $a=a_{1} 2^{n-1}+a_{1} 2^{n-2}+\cdots+a_{n-1}$, $f(a)=a_{0}+a_{1}+\cdots+a_{n-1}$.
For a binary number with $n+1$ digits, there are two cases:
(i) $2 a=a_{0} 2^{n}+a_{1} 2^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{n-1} \cdot 2$, the sum of its digits is $a_{0}+a_{1}+\cdots+a_{n-1}=f(a)$, and $f(2 a)=f(a)$, i.e., the sum of the digits of $f(2 \cdot a)$ is the sum of the digits of $2 a$.
(ii) $2 a+1=a_{0} 2^{n}+a_{1} 2^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{n-1} \cdot 2+1$, the sum of its digits is
$a_{0}+a_{1}+\cdots+a_{n-1}+1=f(a)+1$.
Also, $f(2 a+1)=f(2 a)+1=f(a)+1$, i.e., $f(2 a+1)$ is also the sum of the digits of $2 a+1$.
Thus, we have proven by mathematical induction that when $a$ is a number represented in binary, $f(a)$ is the sum of the digits of $a$.
Since $2^{10}+2^{9}+\cdots+2+1=2^{11}-1=2047>1989$, and
$1989=2^{10}+2^{9}+2^{8}+2^{7}+2^{6}+2^{2}+1=(11111000101)_{2}$,

thus $M_{\max }=10$.
The binary representation of numbers not exceeding 1989 in decimal is a ten-digit number, $(1111111111)_{2}=1023$ and four eleven-digit numbers $(10111111111)_{2}=1535,(11011111111)_{2}=1791,(11101111111)_{2}=1919,(11110111111)_{2}=1983$.

fb5e33f5-ffd3-5729-bb71-f3581e0b30f3,proof,no,,no,yes,"1. **Define the function and its domain:**
   We are given a function \( f:\mathbb{R}_{>0} \to \mathbb{R} \) defined by
   \[
   f(x) = \prod_{i=1}^n (1 + a_i^x)
   \]
   where \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) are positive real numbers such that their product is 1, i.e., \( \prod_{i=1}^n a_i = 1 \).

2. **Differentiate the function:**
   To show that \( f(x) \) is non-decreasing, we need to show that \( f'(x) \geq 0 \) for all \( x > 0 \). Using the product rule, we find the derivative of \( f(x) \):
   \[
   f'(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i^x \ln a_i \prod_{j \neq i} (1 + a_j^x)
   \]
   Dividing both sides by \( f(x) \), we get:
   \[
   \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{a_i^x \ln a_i}{1 + a_i^x}
   \]

3. **Establish the claim:**
   We claim that for all \( a > 0 \) and \( x > 0 \),
   \[
   \frac{a^x \ln a}{1 + a^x} \geq \frac{\ln a}{2}
   \]
   - For \( a \geq 1 \):
     \[
     \frac{a^x \ln a}{1 + a^x} \geq \frac{\ln a}{2}
     \]
     Since \( a^x \geq 1 \), we have \( 1 + a^x \leq 2a^x \). Thus,
     \[
     \frac{a^x \ln a}{1 + a^x} \geq \frac{a^x \ln a}{2a^x} = \frac{\ln a}{2}
     \]
   - For \( 0 < a < 1 \):
     \[
     \frac{a^x \ln a}{1 + a^x} \geq \frac{\ln a}{2}
     \]
     Since \( a^x \leq 1 \), we have \( 1 + a^x \leq 2 \). Thus,
     \[
     \frac{a^x \ln a}{1 + a^x} \geq \frac{a^x \ln a}{2} \geq \frac{\ln a}{2}
     \]
     because \( \ln a < 0 \) for \( 0 < a < 1 \).

4. **Apply the claim:**
   Using the claim, we have:
   \[
   \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} \geq \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\ln a_i}{2}
   \]
   Since \( \prod_{i=1}^n a_i = 1 \), we have:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^n \ln a_i = \ln \left( \prod_{i=1}^n a_i \right) = \ln 1 = 0
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} \geq \frac{0}{2} = 0
   \]
   This implies that \( f'(x) \geq 0 \) for all \( x > 0 \).

   Since \( f'(x) \geq 0 \) for all \( x > 0 \), the function \( f(x) \) is non-decreasing.
